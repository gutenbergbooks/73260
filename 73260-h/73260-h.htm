<p class="unindent"><i>May 23.</i>—I had scarcely opened my eyes, after
the first night’s rest in Abyssinia, when a heavy
knocking at the door, and repeated calls for me,
made me get up in a great hurry to know the reason
of such a disturbance. I found the escort all in an
uproar, and they pushed past me into the house
for their weapons, where they had been safely
deposited under my care, and which, as soon as
they were seized, away my friends ran, one after
another, in the direction of Dinnomalee. Ohmed
Medina, who had suddenly sprung up from somewhere,
sat upon his mule in the market-place, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_002">2</span>
was shouting for me to come, whilst one of his
slaves was hastily saddling my mule also. I could
not make out what was the matter, but as the word
“Galla” was in the mouth of every one, I suspected
that an attack had been made upon the stores
during the night by those marauders, and began to
be afraid that I had calculated too surely upon their
being safe when at Dinnomalee.</p>

<p>Getting myself ready as quickly as possible, I was
soon galloping along the road, following Ohmed Medina.
We stayed not a moment at Dinnomalee, but
a look satisfied my greatest anxiety; for the stores
were all safe, and I cared for nothing else, so with
a mind much easier, I called out to Ohmed Medina,
for the first time, to ask what, and where the disturbance
was. He only turned his face towards
me, as he called out “Dophan,” and “Galla,”
urging his mule on as he spoke, as if he wished he
had wings to fly at once to the little town of half-civilized
Wahamas, we had passed yesterday on this
side of Kokki. We overtook, and gradually left
behind us, all the Hy Soumaulee, who, in a far-apart,
straggling line, were hastening to the rescue.
As we came up to each of these, a vain attempt was
made to keep alongside of us, but our pace was too
good, and we entered alone the small densely-wooded
valley, then along the deep ravine, and at length
pulled up on the camping ground we had left yesterday
morning, when the leading camels of the
Hy Soumaulee Kafilah came in sight, and where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_003">3</span>
they had halted for the night; the greater part of
the Tajourah camels alone coming on after us to
Dinnomalee the same day.</p>

<p>On our arrival, preparations were being hastily
made by the Kafilah to proceed on the march to
Dinnomalee; all seemed conscious they had stayed
in this place a night too long, and anxious to get
away before any other mishap should happen. Some
busy talkers surrounded Ohmed Mahomed and Ebin
Izaak, who had come in a few minutes before us,
and were listening to details of the deeds of blood,
the evidences of which were five still bleeding
bodies, that lay naked in different places upon the
little green sloping bank that rose from the stream,
and upon which the encampment stood.</p>

<p>Carmel Ibrahim and another of my escort were
busy paring the skin of a goat, just killed, into the
little twisted “symbil,” or ornaments, with which it
is usual to adorn the head, wrists, ankles, and also the
weapons of warriors who have slain a foe. Whilst
thus employed, they sung in a sharp falsetto voice
some song of triumph, their voices being elevated
considerably, as every fresh comer from Dinnomalee
arrived. Above us, to the left, the inhabitants of the
little town were making sad lamentations, and loud
sobbing cries over the dead body of one of their
people who had been killed in the engagement.</p>

<p>From what we were now told, it appeared that a
little before sunrise, several women of the Kafilah
had gone down to a place at some distance from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_004">4</span>
the camp, where the little stream spread out into a
pool, to fill their affaleetahs and gourd-shells with
water for the march. Here they were seized by a
large body of Hittoo Gallas, who, during the night,
had approached the Kafilah, and were lying concealed
in this situation, awaiting for the camels to
be loaded, so that after an attack they might drive
them with their loads quickly away. On being
discovered, the greater part seized the women and
carried them away at once, whilst another body
rushed over the little stream hoping still to be able
to surprise the Kafilah before the men had
assembled for its protection. One Dophanter man,
who had followed the women, attempted to escape
by running towards the camp, but a pursuing Galla
launched his spear, and transfixed him through the
back, so that a wound was visible under the breast,
corresponding to the much larger one in the back.
His cries, however, called the Hy Soumaulee to
arms, of whom more than four times the number
of the Galla collected immediately, and before the
latter were aware of the strength of the party they
were about to attack, they were too near to escape
some retributive punishment. Immediately the Hy
Soumaulee saw them commencing to retire, they
were on their feet, following them fast down the
little slope to the brook, and succeeded in killing
five of the daring robbers, before they could ascend
the opposite bank. The rest made good their
retreat to the main body, who had now got some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_005">5</span>
distance with the women, and together formed a force
far too great for the Hy Soumaulee people to hope to
attack it with advantage. They were obliged, therefore
to halt, form a semicircular squatting line, and
be passive spectators of their women, seven of whom
belonged to the Kafilah, and three to the town of
Dophan, being carried away into captivity.</p>

<p>Three Gallas were killed by spears, the others had
been stabbed in the throat and chest, and probably
died fighting fairly enough. Carmel Ibrahim was one
happy man-slayer, and also the brother of Moosa, and
they kept up their song of triumph all the time we
stayed here, except when they took me to see the
bodies of those they had killed. I observed that the
Dankalli do not practise the brutal custom of disfiguring
the slain, so common among the Amhara
at the present time, and which was also a characteristic
of Jewish warfare. The arms and shields,
not only of the Gallas who had been killed, but
also numerous others that the fugitives had thrown
away, fell to the lot of those who picked them up
in the latter case, and to the victors in the former.
Two of the other successful Hy Soumaulee were so
busy fixing in their own belts the newly-obtained
knives, which were much better than their own,
that they did not attempt to raise the song, like
Carmel and his friend, who, perhaps, only did it to
attract my attention. Ohmed Medina informed me
that I must give them a present, and upon my
asking why, he said it was the custom for masters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_006">6</span>
so to reward brave servants. He assured me that
the chief of the town of Dophan had already given
them a goat, and that the Wallasmah would also
do the same. Seeing that it was the general custom,
and as they had only been doing their duty, not
as aggressors, but as men defending their wives and
property, I promised them a bullock. On my doing
this they would insist upon decorating my head with
a symbil, or wreath of twisted goatskin, like themselves,
but I managed to induce them at last to place
it on my hat instead. Before we left the ground,
I asked Ohmed Medina, if the dead Gallas would
be buried. He looked at me, rather astonished at
the question, but thinking, I suppose, that I knew
no better, he said, very shortly, “Koran yahklur”
(the ravens will eat them).</p>

<p>Our curiosity being satisfied, we now followed
the camels, already some distance on their way to
Dinnomalee, conversing as we rode along upon the
events of the morning. The Hy Soumaulee men
were too excited to think of the captive girls taken
from amongst them never to return, but several
of the women of the Kafilah I noticed with tear-shot
eye mourning the loss of some friend or relation.
No usual occupation, such as plaiting the
palm leaf into a broad ribbon, to be sewed afterwards
into mats, filled their hands, no familiar
salutations as I passed by enlivened the way with
smiles, but each with a long rope fastened around
the under jaw of a camel led strings of five or six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_007">7</span>
of these animals, that followed in their peculiarly
quiet manner, the path their sorrowing conductress
pursued.</p>

<p>Myself and others of the party who were
mounted soon went a-head, and had it not been
for repeated stoppages on the road to relate to
those still coming, all we had learned of the deed
of blood, we should have returned to Dinnomalee
by ten o’clock; as it was, the sun had passed the
meridian when we arrived, and we found there an
equally busy scene, but of a very different character,
to the one we had been partial witnesses of at
Dophan.</p>

<p>During our absence the Wallasmah Mahomed,
attended by his brother, two sons, his scribe, and
a whole host of armed followers, had come into
Farree, and just at the moment we passed the first
trees on our side that inclosed the open space
where stood the stores, salt, and merchandise of
our Kafilah, that officer and his party emerged
from the jungly wood opposite; the Wallasmah
riding upon a mule, the rest walking, and among
these the bearers of the silver mounted shield, and
the silver sword of office were most conspicuous.</p>

<p>The Wallasmah Mahomed, the hereditary Prince
or Governor of Efat, imbodied my idea of a dull,
sensual, yet cunning man. There was nothing in
his countenance to recommend him; bloated, with
a heavy stupid expression, a little relieved certainly
by small restless eyes that glanced at me whenever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_008">8</span>
he thought I was not looking at him. Perhaps his
fleshy turned up nose might be termed by some
physiognomists an aspiring feature, and his chubby
mouth, from having lost all his teeth, or nearly so,
was continually mumbling something or other, or
else munching a little branch of wormwood. I will
not charge him with being actually sober, nor
would he, I think, have sworn upon the Koran
that he was so himself; but a bad headache was
pleaded for the narrow rag of blue cotton that
bound a large fresh green leaf upon his forehead.
This application, I was told, was to produce a
sense of coolness in the part affected, and to aid
its effects it was frequently wetted by an attendant
with water from a gourd shell, carried for this
purpose.</p>

<p>On my going up to speak to the old gentleman,
who had already seated himself upon a mat in the
round shade of one of the trees, he very politely
drew up his legs more under him, and invited me
with a wave of his hand to be seated by his side.
An inspection of my carabine immediately followed
this; putting it up to his shoulder he glanced
his eye along the barrels, and then turned round,
with a nod and a sly wink, as if he wished me
to believe that he knew all about it. He now
asked, through Ohmed Medina, if I had any letters,
and never supposing that they would be taken
from me, I told him there were two packets which
I must deliver to the British Embassy at Ankobar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_009">9</span>
that day if possible. Saying this, I got up, and
pointing to the sun intimated that it would be too
late unless I started; but immediately catching hold
of the skirt of my blouse he pulled me down again,
saying, “I must stay with him, for the King had
ordered that I was to remain at Farree, and not go
any farther into the country.” This was fully explained
by Ohmed Medina, who also told me that
Ebin Izaak had been obliged to give up the letters
and despatches whilst I had been talking to the old
man.</p>

<p>I had been misled, though most unintentionally
on the part of Mr. Cruttenden, by his information
of the great honour and reverence with which the
King of Shoa, Sahale Selassee, treated the members
of our political mission, and I had supposed it was
merely necessary for me to be the bearer of despatches
from the coast, to be received with all
cordiality and freedom from suspicion as to the
motives of my visit on my arrival in Shoa. How
disappointed I was may be imagined when, instead
of being permitted to proceed at once to the
residency in Ankobar, I found myself a prisoner;
and on my telling the Wallasmah that my queen
would be very angry when she came to hear of the
letters being taken from me, he very coolly
threatened to have me chained, confirming the
interpretation of Ohmed Medina, by placing his
two wrists together as if bound. As I saw he was
in earnest, and that if I said any more it might,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_010">10</span>
perhaps, place our ambassador in a worse position
than what he seemed to be in, I restrained my
feelings, and retired to think over my situation and
what I conceived to be that of the mission in Shoa.
Having sent a short note by a messenger the day
before to Captain Harris, announcing my arrival,
I postponed taking any decided steps until I
received his answer, for I now contemplated
making my escape back again, to take the news
to Aden of the condition of our embassy, the
members of which were stated to be prisoners
like myself.</p>

<p>I had not sat alone long, when some of the Wallasmah’s
people came to tell me I must go to
Farree with them. I asked for my mule, but
found it had been taken away to have the benefit,
as they significantly told me, of the King’s own
pasturage. There was nothing to be done but
to accompany them; so telling some of the Hy Soumaulee
to come to Farree the next morning to see
me, and if I were not there to go on to Ankobar, I
proceeded with my guides, or guards, to the same
house I slept in the last night; and the ready
smiling welcome, the little bustle to receive me
cordially, I met with from the good-natured
inmates, was some set-off to the brutal indifference
of the state-gaoler; for such office also I found was
filled by the head of the customs of Shoa, the
Abigass, or frontier governor of Efat, the obsequious
spiteful pluralist the Wallasmah Mahomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_011">11</span>
I passed the night, having received no answer to
my note from Ankobar, wishing for the day, still
hoping that I might be mistaken in my fears, and
that some of the members of the embassy would
come to congratulate me on my safe arrival, and
free me from the anxiety, restraint, and espionage
I was now annoyed with; for two sentinels were
constantly on duty in the little enclosure, and
always present in the house, when I received visits
even from my Hy Soumaulee friends.</p>

<p>The next day came, but no news from Ankobar.
I amused myself as well as I could, writing up my
notes and settling small accounts with my escort
and those of the Kafilah people, from whose importunities
on the road I had relieved myself by
promises of presents in Shoa, and who now came
for paper, needles, buttons, scissors, and razors.
Almost all that I possessed was divided among them
as some little return for their continued kindness
and fidelity to me on the road; for I had little to
complain of except the continual falsehoods and
petty deceits practised invariably by the Tajourah
people. Even Ohmed Medina was not altogether
exempt from this failing; but it was from a motive of
well-meant kindness, so that I should not be able to
detect the number of instances that little attempts
were made to impose upon me, and which he
thought might lead to expostulation and angry
discussions.</p>

</div>


<p class="unindent">I <span class="smcap">stayed</span> in Farree anxiously awaiting some news
from the embassy, until the 25th; but neither note
nor messenger came to relieve the suspense I was
in. The night before, Ohmed Medina, however,
had called upon me, and told me that all was right
as regarded their personal safety, but informed me
that my note from the Dinnomalee had been intercepted
by the Wallasmah, and that none of the
English in Shoa knew that I was in the country.
I made up my mind, on hearing this, to attempt
getting to Ankobar the next morning, if it were
possible; and accordingly, before it was light,
opened the little wicket that served for the door,
passed unobserved the two sentinels who lay
wrapped up in their body cloths fast asleep, and was
soon some distance on the wrong road; that is to
say, the most circuitous one to Ankobar. I thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_013">13</span>
that I was not exactly right, and meeting some
labourers going into the fields to work, I asked the
way, by repeating the word, Ankobar. They were
too much surprised to speak, but pointed in the
direction of the road, and I left them staring after
me with a wondering look, as if to ask what would
come next. Having reached a village about five
miles to the north-west of Farree, I found it
impossible to go on, it having been one continual
ascent along the roughest and most winding path
that can well be imagined. Oppressed with difficulty
of breathing, fatigued, and foot-sore, I turned
toward the door of the first house, and sitting down
on a stone, made signs that I wanted some water.
Hereupon such a screaming was set up by the only
inmates, two naked children, that it could not have
been exceeded if I had intimated that they were
about to be devoured. Their cries brought two other
little girls, who came running round the house, but
seeing me, promptly turned back, tumbling over each
other to get out of the way, contributing as they lay
not a little to the frantic roaring of the children
inside.</p>

<p>The noise soon brought all the disposable people,
men and women of all ages, who had not left the
village for their labours in the fields, who soon recognised
in their visitor a Gypt or Egyptian, as the Abyssinians
call all white men. I was glad to find that
the character seemed to be a very respected one,
although the first evidence I had of it, was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_014">14</span>
numerous beggars for articles, the names of which I
did not understand. They invited me into the house
out of the sun, and a large wooden mortar was laid
on its side for me to sit upon, whilst several women
employed themselves scorching some coffee beans,
in a coarse earthenware saucer over a little wood
fire in the centre of a circular hearth, that
occupied the middle of the room. The whole
house consisted of this one apartment, the surrounding
wall being composed of sticks placed
close together, and about four feet high, upon
which rested a straw thatched roof frame of light
bamboo, well blackened with the smoke.</p>

<p>I had not long arrived at Garcia Mulloo, the
name of the village, before I was followed by a
large body of men armed with spears and staves,
and dragging along with them, most unwillingly,
my old grey mule. The misselannee of Farree,
whom I knew, was at the head of the party, and
appeared very well pleased to see me, addressing me
with great politeness, though I could not understand
a word that he said. I took care, however,
in Arabic, to charge him and the Wallasmah with
incivility, and want of hospitality, for detaining me
so long in Farree against my will, and also with
having, like a thief, stolen the note I had sent to
Ankobar. As we had been now joined by a man
named Brekka, who understood what I said, he
interpreted for us, and afforded the misselannee an
opportunity in reply, of throwing the whole blame
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_015">15</span>
upon the Wallasmah, whose servant he was, at
the same time begging me to return with him, for
which purpose, and for my accommodation, he had
brought my mule along with him. I positively
refused, on the plea, that their King had promised
mine, that Englishmen were to travel unmolested
through the country, alluding to the treaty,
and that, accordingly, if they now used force to
take me back to Farree, it would bring the matter
to an issue, and my people would then see the
real value of the word of Sahale Selassee. Seeing
I was determined not to return with them they
agreed to compromise the matter, upon my
promising to remain at Garcia Mulloo, and not
attempt to proceed farther towards Ankobar, until
the King’s pleasure respecting me should be
known. This I was induced to do by the misselannee’s
pacific appeal that I would not do anything
which would occasion him to be imprisoned, and
all his property confiscated.</p>

<p>Our interpreter, Brekka, was a scamp of a
renegado, who had been a Christian, but was
converted to the Islam faith, by the promise of a
situation under the Wallasmah, whose district,
the province of Efat, is inhabited chiefly by
Mahomedans. The contiguity of the two faiths
among a people of one origin, affords an interesting
opportunity of examining the first effect of
differences in religious belief, and which leads,
in the course of time, to the division of one family
of man into two distinct nations, differing in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_016">16</span>
customs, pursuits, and even, after a lapse of time,
in physical features.</p>

<p>The same dispersing operation of opinion, but
more advanced, is to be observed in the separation,
at the present day, of the Dankalli and Soumaulee
tribes, and to any zealous student of the science of
all sciences, humanity, or the natural history of
man, it is indispensably necessary that he should
visit the countries of Abyssinia, of Sennaar, and
Adal, where he will find collected, as at a centre,
the originals of all the different varieties into
which physiologists have divided the human race;
and where, at this moment, the principal causes of
the great moral change in the condition of man, consequent
upon the flood, may be observed in full operation,
and producing the same effects of dispersion.
Christian civilization, which points to a future
union, is the antagonizing principle to the opinion
disturbing one, which, I believe, alone separates and
divides mankind; and I could wish to see, here, in
intertropical Africa, a Mission of enlightened
ministers of the Gospel, whose object should be
simply to spread the easily understood doctrine of
one God, and that love and truth are the redeeming
principles in the character of man, to restore him
to that state of excellence from which he has
fallen.</p>

<p>It being arranged I should stay at Garcia
Mulloo, a supply of bread and beer was ordered
by the misselanee, who had been sent for to see
after this duty; the same officer of the town of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_017">17</span>
Farree, returning there with his party, taking my
mule along with them, and leaving Brekka and
another man to keep me company, as was said, but
in fact, to keep guard over me. A disjointed conversation
with the former served to amuse me
during the rest of the day. He gave me some information
respecting the Embassy, and of the dislike
entertained by Sahale Selassee to the English;
which surprised me considerably, nor would I at
first believe it, but ascribed the statement to the
ill feeling and jealousy with which the visit of our
Political Mission to the Court of Shoa, was viewed
by the Mahomedans of Efat.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Brekka walked down to Farree,
and when he returned, told me he had seen a
letter for me, and a messenger from Ankobar, and
that if I wished to see them I must go to that
town. I did not hesitate a moment, but was now
as anxious to be off, as I was before obstinately
bent upon remaining. The news of Brekka being
confirmed by the arrival of a messenger from the
Wallasmah, with the same information, I started
immediately. I conceived that the not sending
the letter to Garcia Mulloo, was perhaps intended
as a kind of punishment for my breaking prison in
the morning.</p>

<p>In about an hour and a-half, we were again
crossing the little stream which flows at the base of
the hill on which Farree stands; and I was soon
seated in my old quarters, whilst Brekka went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_018">18</span>
to obtain for me the expected note. When he
returned, he brought me an order to go to the
Wallasmah myself, as he wanted to see me; and who
occupied a house upon one of the little eminences
opposite to mine. I was not long in presenting
myself in obedience to this summons, and found
that gentleman sitting upon a large oxskin
spread upon the ground, paring his toe nails
with an old pocket knife. As I came round
the low stone fence against which he leaned, he
cast his eyes upon me, and growled a very sinister
kind of salutation, asking me in broken Arabic
how I did. I now requested him to give me the
letter from Ankobar, but he only shook his head.
I asked to see the messenger, and with a chuckle
of triumphant cunning, he pointed with the open
knife to the fastened door of an outhouse, an action
which I readily interpreted to mean, “He is there,
in prison.” I did not say a word more, but walked
away in high dudgeon, overturning a rude Abyssinian
who, with spear and shield pushed against
me, as if to prevent my exit when I made my way
out through a little wicket in the stick enclosure
that surrounded the house.</p>

<p>The worst of my situation was, that I had no
friends near, all the Hy Soumaulee and Tajourah
people being according to custom, obliged to
locate themselves during their stay in Shoa, in a
little town called Channo, situated about two
miles to the north-east of Farree, where they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_019">19</span>
compelled to leave their shields and spears when they
go farther into the interior of the country. I had
to send for any of these to come to me, but either
it was too late in the day, being after sunset, or
orders had been issued to the contrary, for I could
induce no one to take a message from me either to
Ohmed Medina or Carmel Ibrahim. I was obliged,
therefore, to remain quiet for the night, being determined,
however, on the morrow to escape into the
Adal country, and carry the news back, which
otherwise might be a long time in reaching Aden,
of the actual condition of things in Shoa; where,
instead of the English being courted and caressed,
as was believed to be the case when I was in
Tajourah, they were, in fact, the objects of the
most jealous suspicion, and subjected to the most
tyrannical surveillance, if not actually in prison.</p>

<p>The early part of the morning of the 26th of
May was occupied in projecting the plan of my
escape with Carmel Ibrahim and Adam Burrah,
the latter of whom having assisted Lieut. Barker
in getting through the Adal country after that
gentleman had left the Hurrah Kafilah, I could the
more confidently rely upon, although I had not the
least doubt of the fidelity or trustworthiness of the
former. These two had come with Allee the First
to laugh with me at my attempt of getting to
Ankobar the day before, and endeavoured to soothe
and interest me, as they thought, by showing how
they would disembowel the old fat Wallasmah
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_020">20</span>
if they had him in their country. My proposal to
go back was met with their decided approbation.
It was accordingly arranged that Carmel and Adam
should accompany me in the evening, whilst the rest
of the escort were to remain, and during the night
manage to steal my mule, and as many more as they
could, and join us at the little Wahama town
Dophan, beyond which they knew very well no
attempt would be made to pursue us.</p>

<p>I was in the act of making a few cartridges for
my anticipated return journey, when I heard a
loud cry of “Commander, Commander,” an English
word, by which the Abyssinians had been taught to
designate the head of the Mission. Two or three
of the inhabitants of Farree came also in a great
hurry to call me out of the house, and tell me that
some Gypt or other was approaching. I was
equally eager, and even ran in a most undignified
manner to meet this messenger of light, who,
mounted on a mule, now appeared upon the
summit or crest of the road before it descends into
the little hollow where stands the market-place.
There was a great air of civilization about him.
He wore a broad-brimmed hat, somewhat like my
own, covered with white cotton cloth, a sailor’s
large pea-jacket belted round his waist, an old
pair of grey check trowsers, and came with a sober
steady pace along the narrow path.</p>

<p>I met him as he dismounted beneath the few
mimosa-trees, and after a hearty shake of the hand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_021">21</span>
invited him to my <em>hotel</em>. He then introduced
himself as Mr. R. Scott, the surveying draughtsman
attached to the Mission.</p>

<p>His first explanation was the cause of his non-arrival
sooner, which was owing to the utter
ignorance of my arrival on the part of Captain
Harris, the chief of the Embassy, until the night
but one before, when the King had forwarded
by one of his pages two notes, which I had endeavoured
to send to him, the last one dated from
Dinnomalee. The other was the one which had
been sent by Esau Ibrahim, who, it will be remembered,
was despatched from Mullu, on the other
side of the Hawash, with a note to Ankobar,
informing Captain Harris of my being on the road
with stores. Both these letters had been intercepted
and detained, until public rumour spreading,
the King could not have kept the Embassy much
longer ignorant of my being in the country; and
he therefore made a virtue of necessity, and sent
the letters before they were demanded.</p>

<p>An answer had been sent to me by Capt. Harris
the day before by the messenger now in prison,
confined by the Wallasmah for having brought a
letter for me, after the King had issued orders
that all correspondence between the English
already in the country and those arriving should
be prevented. Mr. Scott was not at all surprised
when I informed him of the circumstance, though
I certainly considered such a proceeding to be very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_022">22</span>
much at variance with the conditions and stipulations
I was given to understand were contained
in the commercial treaty. I could not help
remarking this, and Mr. Scott then candidly
admitted the King did not know the character or
purport of the paper he had signed; and had only
been made aware of the new responsibilities he
had incurred, by a sharply worded expostulatory
letter, written by Mr. Krapf, in accordance to
the dictation of Captain Harris, on an occasion
subsequently to the signing of the treaty, when
despatches and letters coming up from the coast
were intercepted and detained for some time by
the orders of the King. Singularly enough, this
information was corroborated by Ohmed Medina, who
told me that my letter from Dinnomalee had not
been carried to Captain Harris, but to the King,
who wanted to find out whether the English were
his friends or not, and was trying my disposition
and that of the Commander (Captain Harris) by
this harsh treatment of me; a kind of experiment,
in fact, to see what would be borne by us, and how
far he had limited his authority by attaching his
signature to the treaty. Any idea of granting
public benefit, at the expense of his prerogative was
never entertained for a moment, the intentions of
the King being limited to shewing personal favour
alone, which he is ever ready to concede even now
to English travellers, much as he complains of the
conduct of the Mission in Shoa as regards their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_023">23</span>
political misdoings; more especially of the great
insult offered to him by the unfortunate letter
before alluded to, and which was worded so
unguardedly, that the King, on receiving it, might
well, considering his great regard for Mr. Krapf
previously, turn to him and say, in a tone that
implied more of sorrow than of anger, “Did you
write that, my father?”</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>May 26, 1842.</i>—After Mr. Scott joined me at
Farree, I considered that all my troubles were at
an end, although I had still to go above fifty miles
before I could meet the members of the British
Political Mission who had accompanied the King
to his residence at Angolahlah, the most western
town of his dominions. An establishment was
still kept up at Ankobar, situated about one third of
the way between Farree and Angolahlah, at the
head of which was the naturalist attached to the
Mission, Dr. Roth, with whom was Mr. Bernatz,
the artist, and there also Mr. Scott was stationed.
Captain Harris the Ambassador, Captain Graham,
the second in command, and Mr. Assistant-Surgeon
Kirk, lived at Angolahlah, where I now expected
to be permitted to go by my gaoler the Wallasmah.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_025">25</span>
I found, however, I was reckoning without my
host, for a new difficulty had arisen, from the circumstance
of Mr. Scott having come down to
Farree without the permission of Walda-anna,
the Governor of Ankobar. He was accordingly
given to understand that he must consider himself
a prisoner with me until the pleasure of the negoos
should be known as to our disposal. It was in
vain we expostulated with our surly gaoler; we
were to be opposed by force if we attempted to
leave Farree, and other sentinels were charged
with the care of us. Something we did effect, and
that was the liberation of the messenger who was
detected bringing me a letter the day before, for as
soon as this request was made to the Wallasmah it
was at once acceded to, and the man was ordered
to be set at liberty. Taking this as an evidence of
some relaxation of the harsh treatment with which
we had been treated, we sat sometime chatting
with the old gentleman, and I hinted my intention
of making him some present if he would honour
me so far as to accept of my poor gifts. When we
got up from the ground where we had been sitting,
the Wallasmah directed his son, a fine young man
about three or four and twenty years old, to accompany
us to our residence; a sufficient intimation of
his being graciously disposed, without the broad
hint given by one of his followers, who whispered
into the ears of Mr. Scott, “Give your <dfn>memolagee</dfn>
to that man.” Our imprisoned servant not making
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_026">26</span>
his appearance before we left the Wallasmah, we
asked where he was, and were surprised to hear that
he had left Farree for Angolahlah without seeing
us, but which we supposed he had been obliged to
do, so that there should be no chance of our slipping
a note into his hands for our friends in that
town.</p>

<p>We returned to our house, and for the rest of
the day amused ourselves with hearing and telling
whatever most interested us, whether of home or
foreign news. I must observe that a present of
three pieces of calico and a pound of gunpowder
was made to the Wallasmah, who sent us back his
compliments, and that he was highly delighted with
the present, but would be obliged for a little more
gunpowder.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott and I were entertained and taken care
of for four days in Farree, much to our discomfort
and vexation. Fortunately this gentleman had
brought with him two native servants, who made
themselves useful by marketing and cooking
during the term of our confinement, so we suffered
nothing from want of food. We could also walk
about the straggling town on pledging our word
that we would not attempt to escape, although our
parole was not deemed sufficient, for, like Buonaparte
at St. Helena, two sentinels, on such excursions,
always followed at a certain distance in our
rear.</p>

<p>Many of the houses in Farree, instead of being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_027">27</span>
the usual circle of closely placed sticks, some five
feet high and surmounted by a high conical straw
roof, are partial excavations in the soft trachytic
stone, so as to leave a back and sides of natural
rock. Over this is laid a flat roof, consisting of
untrimmed rafters covered by a thick layer of
brushwood, upon which is placed a layer of earth
some inches in thickness, well stamped down with
the feet. A front of wattled sticks, in which the
entrance is made, completes the house, and in one
such as this was I lodged during my stay in this
town.</p>

<p>The internal arrangements were equally simple.
A raised platform of stones and clay, about two
feet high, occupied one half of the single apartment,
and upon one end of this, reaching to the
roof, stood a huge butt-like basket, smoothly
plastered over inside and out with clay. This was
the family granary, in which was preserved the
teff seed, or wheat, from the depredations of the
numerous mice that are a thorough pest in Abyssinia.
In a corner below, stood side by side two of
the peculiar handmills used in this country, each
consisting of a large flat stone of cellular lava,
two feet long and one foot broad, raised upon a
rude pedestal of stones and mud, about one foot
and a half from the ground. The rough surface
of this stone sloped gradually down from behind
forwards into a basin-like cavity, into which the
flour falls as it is ground. A second stone, grasped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_028">28</span>
in the hand of the woman who grinds, weighs
about three pounds, beneath which, as it is moved
up and down the inclined plane of the under millstone,
the grain is crushed, and gradually converted
into a coarse flour.</p>

<p>This is the same kind of mill that was used by
the ancient Egyptians, and is represented in the
excellent work upon those people, recently written
by Sir G. Wilkinson, although he describes it as
being used for fulling clothes, having mistaken,
I suppose, the flour represented as falling into the
cup-like recipient for a stream of water. I observe,
also, in another plate in the same work, a representation
of this mill, but without any allusion to
its real purposes. Moses, in the fifth verse of the
eleventh chapter of Exodus, describes exactly the character
of the occupation, and the instrument, where
he speaks “of the maid-servant that is behind the
mill,” for women are only employed on this duty,
and they always stand in the rear, leaning forward
over their work. Very few houses, those only of
the poorest people, have but one mill; generally
two or more stand side by side in a row, and
the number is always mentioned when the idea is
wished to be conveyed of the large dependent
retinue that the master of the house feeds.</p>

<p>A few large jars containing water, or ale,
ranged along one side of the house, and a shield
hung from the projecting end of one of the sticks
that formed the front, were the only articles that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_029">29</span>
occupied prominent positions as furniture in my
residence. Three or four “maceroitsh,” or earthenware
pots for cooking, generally lay upset in the
white wood ashes contained in the large circular
hearth that occupied a portion of the floor opposite
to the mills; and some of the necessary but small
instruments for clearing or spinning cotton were
placed when not being used upon a skin bag, in which
a quantity of that useful material was contained.</p>

<p>I was very much struck with the extreme contrasts
that could be drawn between the inhabitants
of Farree and the Dankalli Bedouins. The large
and portly forms of the former, their apparent
love of quiet, the affection they evinced for their
children, and that of the children for their parents,
were all points characteristic of these great
differences. The physiognomy of the two people
exhibited equally varying features, and as the men
of Farree are a good type of the real Amhara
population, I shall endeavour to give an idea of
the form of the countenance and the head peculiar
to this family of man, by a description drawn from
my first observations in that town, where the people
have less admixture of Galla blood, than the inhabitants
of the table land of Shoa above and beyond
them.</p>

<p>This will be preceded, however, by some
necessary, and, I believe, novel information
respecting the origin of the Amhara, which I
became acquainted with during my residence in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_030">30</span>
Shoa, and which has been singularly confirmed by
a comparison of the reports and prejudices I noted
down while in that country, with recorded circumstances
of the earlier history of Egypt, and of other
powerful empires that once existed along the
course of the Nile.</p>

<p>Amhara, which word is at present only used to
designate the Christian population of Abyssinia,
was, previous to the introduction of the Mahomedan
religion, the descriptive appellation of an extensive
red people, who principally occupied the eastern border
of the Abyssinian table land, from the latitude
of Massoah in the north to that of lake Zui in the
south. To the west of these, and occupying the
portion of the table land in that direction, lived
a people decidedly different in their complexion,
their features, their language, their religion, and
their customs. These were the Gongas, or Agows,
who I believe to have been the original possessors
of the whole plateau, until a period remarkable
in history, when the Emperor of Meroë or Ethiopia
located upon a portion of their country, those
disaffected soldiers of Psammeticus who had sought
an asylum in his kingdom. Were I not convinced
that the Amhara population of Abyssinia, at the
present day, can be physically demonstrated to be the
descendants of these fugitives from Egypt, I would
not venture to advance such an innovation upon
the generally received opinion, that the Amhara
are aborigines of the country they now inhabit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_031">31</span>
Under the term Abyssins, Dr. Prichard, in his
invaluable work upon the natural history of man,
includes all the different nations that now inhabit
the lofty plain of Abisha or Abyssinia. Of one
of these nations, the Amhara, he remarks, “So
striking is the resemblance between the modern
Abyssinians and the Hebrews of old, that we can
hardly look upon them but as branches of one
nation, and if we had not convincing evidence to
the contrary, and knew not for certain that the
Abramidæ originated in Chaldæa, and to the northward
and eastward of Palestine, we might frame a
very probable hypothesis, which would bring them
down as a band of wandering shepherds from the
mountains of Habesh, and identify them with the
pastor kings, who, according to Manetho, multiplied
their bands in the land of the Pharaohs,
and being, after some centuries, expelled thence
by the will of the gods, sought refuge in Judea,
and built the walls of Jerusalem. Such an
hypothesis would explain the existence of an
almost Israelitish people, and the preservation of
a language so nearly approaching to the Hebrew
in intertropical Africa.” The learned ethnologist
goes on to observe—“It is certainly untrue; and
we find no other easy explanation of the facts
which the history of Abyssinia presents, and
particularly of the early extension of the Jewish
religion and customs through that country, for
the legend which makes the royal house of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_032">32</span>
Menilek descend from Solomon and the Queen of
Sheba, is as idle a story as ever monks invented to
abuse the reverent ignorance of their lay brethren.”</p>

<p>Herodotus, and other ancient historians and
geographers, have recorded the migration of a vast
body of discontented native soldiers from Egypt, in
the time of Psammeticus. These, we are told, to
the number of 240,000, retired to the country of
Ethiopia, where they were kindly received by the
Emperor. They assisted him in his wars, and in
return were apportioned, as a residence, some
country on the confines of Ethiopia, from which
they were to drive a rebellious people to make
room for themselves. Herodotus places this country
“upon the Nile, at about the same distance beyond
Meroë as this last is from Elephantine, or fifty
days’ journey;” and he also adds, that “the
Antomali (deserters) are known by the name of
Asmach, which, being translated, signifies ‘standing
on the left hand’ of the King.” It is a most
remarkable circumstance that the reason or origin
of the name of the country of Gurague, literally
“on the left side,” has long been a question of
interest with every Abyssinian traveller, but none
have given any satisfactory explanation for what
reason this particular, and evidently significant,
name was first applied. The situation of the
Amhara with respect to the Abi or Bruce’s Nile
at once accounts for the designation, as they live
upon the left hand of the stream as it flows south
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_033">33</span>
from lake Dembea, whilst that portion of this
people still retaining their ancient name and purity
of descent, the present Gurague occupy a country
similarly situated with respect to the river Zebee,
or Azzabi, or Assabinus, the Ethiopian Jupiter. Abi
and Abiah, other names for branches of the Nile in
Abyssinia, are expressive of <em>father</em> or <em>king</em>, evidently
from having been, at a former period, the chief
objects of worship by the people inhabiting their
banks. “Asmach,” and “Gurague,” bear, therefore,
the same interpretation, “to the left of the king,”
and none other can explain the circumstance of the
latter name being given to the Amhara. It appears,
however to have been bestowed in contra-distinction
to the “Gongas,” or “Kongue,” a people who
originally occupied the right banks solely of the
Abi and Abiah.</p>

<p>This singular correspondence between “Asmach”
of the Grecian historian, and “Gurague”
of modern travellers, would be alone, perhaps,
inconclusive evidence that these terms apply to the
same people or country, but some additional
evidence may be drawn from the account which
Pliny gives of these Egyptian fugitives. On the
authority of Aristocreon, he states, that “Seventeen
days from Meroë is Esar, a city of those
Egyptians who fled from Psammeticus, and entered
the service of the monarch of that country, and in
return received a considerable tract of territory
upon the confines, from which the Ethiopian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_034">34</span>
prince ordered them to expel a tribe of people, at
that time in rebellion against him, and this migration
of the Egyptian troops, introducing the arts
and manners of a refined nation, had a very sensible
effect in civilizing the Ethiopians.” The most
interesting particulars we gather from this information,
is the name of the city, or, as I presume, the
chief seat of these fugitives, Esar.</p>

<p>By a singular coincidence in the Old Testament,
we are told that Esau is Edom, and although I am
not going to infer from this alone, any connexion
between that patriarch and the Ethiopian city,
Esar, yet the philological analogy between the
scriptural proper names, curiously enough, also
exists between those of profane history; for the
Esar and Amhara of our subject, express the very
same idea as Esau and Edom, which by all
Biblical commentators, is allowed to be the colour
red. “And the first came out red, all over like an
hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.”
(Genesis <abbr title="twenty-five">xxv.</abbr> 25.)</p>

<p>In the present Dankalli language, and I
think also, in that of ancient Meroë, Assar signifies
red. In the Persian, I am given to understand
that the planet Mars is called Azer, from its
characteristic colour, a circumstance of significant
import when it is considered that the word Calla,
from which is derived Galla, “Ab” the root of
Abi, and “Nil,” from which comes Nile, with
others I have yet to speak of, as designations of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_035">35</span>
places in Abyssinia, are all referable to the same
language. To return, however, to Esar, and its connexion
with the colour red, for it is the same with
Esau, and that it is the same as Edom in Hebrew,
I advance the testimony of Dr. Stukeley, who,
speaking of the Red Sea, remarks, “That sea had
its name from Erythras, as the Greeks and the
same Pliny write; who is Edom, or Esau, brother of
Jacob. The words are synonymous, signifying red.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Amhara, also bears the same interpretation in
Amharic, and although it has another meaning, that
of beautiful, this is only because of the national
taste directing the name of the favourite complexion
among them, to be employed as the term
for beauty itself. The Dankalli slave-merchant
well understands this, for a light-red Abyssinian
girl is the Circassian of oriental harems. In
Arabia, where the original word still conveys the
more common idea, we find “hamah” employed to
express the colour red.</p>

<p>In this manner, I connect the “Asmach” of
Herodotus, with Gurague of modern travellers,
and the Esar of Pliny, with the Amhara of the
present day, and from these two mutually corroborating
correspondencies, the identity of the modern
Abyssinians of Dr. Prichard with the Automali of
Herodotus may perhaps be deduced, and the
difficulty of accounting for a Hebrew people,
situated on the Abyssinian plateau only requires
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_036">36</span>
proof to be advanced that the revolted soldiers of
Psammeticus were of the same family of man as the
fugitive Israelites who sought a refuge, under
nearly similar circumstances, in Syria, and built the
walls of Jerusalem; and as their languages are
nearly the same, as also their manners, customs,
and ancient religion, previous to the introduction of
Christianity, it will not, perhaps, be difficult to
adduce such evidence. For my part, I am inclined
to believe in this national relationship, because it is
partly confirmed by the received account of the
brothers, Esau and Jacob, contained in the book of
Genesis, and the connexion between the two
patriarchs, and the country of Egypt, will perhaps
receive some illustration from the opinion I have
ventured to advance upon the subject. In the
elder brother, Esau, I perceive the father of the
royal shepherds, and among the list of the dukes,
his descendants may be found, perhaps the pastor
kings who held for some time the sovereign power
in Egypt.</p>

<p>The connexion also of the name Esau, or Esar,
with the profession of soldiers, is evident, for in
oriental mythology it is identified with the god
Mars; whilst on the other hand, the word <dfn>Israel</dfn>, in
Hebrew, I believe, as in Amharic has an immediate
reference to <em>labour</em>, as the name Jacob has also to
the <em>heel</em>, which coincides very singularly with the
idea prevalent in India, that the labouring class
have all sprung from the foot of Brahmah. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_037">37</span>
would be very interesting, if future discoveries in
hieroglyphics, or other cotemporary histories, which,
I believe, do exist in central Africa, should prove
that the appearance of the Jews as a family of man,
under the patriarch Abraham, marks the disruption
of an African community of castes, where the
Priest class, excited by the ambition of a Psammeticus,
should determine upon the expulsion of
the soldiers, who thereupon fled to Ethiopia; and,
also, that after a tyrannical and cruel oppression
should ultimately occasion the flight of the workmen,
or Israelites, into Palestine. I leave the question,
however, now, to more profound ethnologists, and
shall conclude this, I am afraid, very uninteresting
subject, with a short but necessary description of
the features and physical characteristics of the
present Amhara population of Abyssinia.</p>

<p>In the British Museum are many Egyptian
statues that possess exactly the features of the
genuine Amhara race. One more, especially of
a woman in the lower saloon marked 16, I will
particularize, to enable those who have the opportunity
of examining these relics of an extinct nation
to form a proper idea of the physiognomy of the
people I am speaking of.</p>

<p>Their general complexion cannot be better
described by reference to a familiar object than
comparing it with that of red unpolished copper.
Their skin is soft and delicate; the general stature
is below the middle height of Europeans. Their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_038">38</span>
forms are not fully developed until they have arrived
at the same years of puberty as ourselves; and it
is very uncommon for women under seventeen to
bear children. The features of the women conform
to a general characteristic type, and less variations
from this are observed among them than in the
men. This observation extends to other races
besides the Amhara, for I have invariably found
more consistency of countenance, more nationality
preserved in the features of females than in the
males of the many different people I have met with
in my travels in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The Amhara face is ovate, having a considerably
greater expression of breadth in the upper than in
the lower part. The scalp in front encroaches upon
the forehead, making its length disproportionate to
its height, and, in consequence, it appears exceedingly
low. The eyes are long, but rather full, and
the separation of the eyelids longitudinal, as in
Europeans. Their cheeks are high, yet finely
rounded, and sometimes, with the long forehead,
giving to the countenance a nearly triangular form.
The nose straight and well-formed, with a small
and beautiful mouth, a finely-curved edge gradually
rising from the commissure to the fulness of a most
inviting pair of lips. A voluptuous fulness, in fact,
pervades the whole countenance; a something more
than muscular fibre, yet not exactly fat, giving a
healthy fleshiness, that reminds you of the chubbiness
of children; and I expect the fascinating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_039">39</span>
expression so generally ascribed to Abyssinian
beauties by all orientals is owing to the idea of
innocence and simplicity, that inseparably connects
itself with this infantile character of face. The hair
is soft and long; it is neither woolly, like the negro,
nor is it the strong, coarse, straight hair of the Gongas,
or yellow inhabitants of the right bank of the
Abi and Abiah branches of the Azzabi, or red Nile.</p>

<p>I saw few or no cases of distortion among
the families I met with in Efat, and my impression
is that they but rarely occur, the natural
and simple lives of the people conducing to easy
parturition and a healthy offspring. The Amhara,
however, in their most unchanged condition in
Gurague, and the neighbouring Christian states,
have yet to be visited. The inhabitants of these
countries may exhibit characteristic traits that I
have had no opportunities of observing, for those I
met with were the most favourable specimens of
the imported slaves, or their immediate descendants,
who were married to Mahomedans of Efat.</p>

<p>Individuals possessing what I believe to have
been the characteristic features of the genuine
Amharic countenance are but seldom seen on the
high land of Shoa, although it might naturally be
expected that their situation would favour a lighter
complexion than the dark-brown Shoans exhibit.
This is to be attributed to the very recent period
that their Galla ancestorial relations intruded themselves
into this former Amhara district, as Abyssinian
history records that the first appearance of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_040">40</span>
invaders from the low plains of Adal occurred no
later than the year 1537.</p>

<p>From the 27th to the 31st of May, Mr. Scott
and I remained in easy durance at Farree. We
were frequently summoned to the presence of the
Wallasmah, whom we would amuse by firing off
my gun, or teaching his son, a boy about fourteen
years old, to let off percussion caps without shutting
his eyes. The dreadful experiment would never be
attempted by papa, but he wonderfully enjoyed the
bright promise of his hopeful progeny, the child of
his old age, who, on the other hand, annoyed us
not a little by the unsatisfied pertness with which
he demanded to be so indulged.</p>

<p>Day after day were we most solemnly promised
that we should start upon the morrow, but without
any intention of being permitted to do so, beyond
the accident occurring of our being sent for by
the King. Perhaps our importunity excited a
desire to gratify us, and what they wished for our
sake the kind-hearted people of Farree asserted
would be, because of the great probability that the
messenger who had been sent to the King to receive
his commands, would return sooner than he did.</p>

<p>I am not going to acquit the Wallasmah on this plea,
for his want of courtesy towards us; for from some
incomprehensible antipathy, he would, had he dared,
have placed us in irons, and even on occasions of
our visiting him, when we endeavoured to do everything
we could to please him, a surly smile was our
only return for some little gratification we might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_041">41</span>
afford to his boy. His people frequently made
excuses for the conduct of their chief, by stating
that he either had been drinking, or else that he
had not; so, drunk or sober, it seemed quite natural
to them that the old fellow should be in a continual
ill-humour from some undefined connexion with
strong drink.</p>

<p>I took care to promise him another present on
the occasion of our leaving Farree, as I conceived
that it might be some expectation of the sort that
was operating to cause our tiresome detention. I
was wrong in this, for it was not his pleasure, but
the King’s, his master, that we should be kept at
Farree, although he tried to make us believe it was
his own, and assuming an authority that did not
belong to him, made our confinement more irksome
than it needed to have been, on purpose to evince
his power. With our sentinels behind us, however,
we could wander all over the hill of Farree, and
we accordingly amused ourselves by endeavouring
to extend our information upon the various
subjects of novel interest with which we were
surrounded.</p>

<p>One observation I cannot do better than to insert
here, respecting the rocks and soil of Farree, which
abound with the nitrate of potass, the bald face of
the former, in many places, being hollowed into
deep grooves by the constant attrition of the
tongues of the numerous flocks and herds, which
seem to be as fond of this salt as the same animals
are of common table salt in other countries; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_042">42</span>
circumstance that is well shown in those saline
resorts of deer and buffaloes, called the “licks” of
North America. The geological structure of the
hills in this neighbourhood is a finely-grained
trachytic rock; grey, save where the intrusion of
narrow dykes of some blacker rocks, a few feet in
thickness, and evidently heated on their first appearance,
has changed the general colour to a deep
red, which gradually recovers its natural hue at the
distance of some yards on either side the dyke.
This rock contains a considerable quantity of
decomposing felt-spar, supplying the potass, and, I
presume, deriving from the atmosphere, and the
moisture it contains, the other necessary elements
to form the thick efflorescence of saltpetre that
covers in some places the surface of the rock.</p>

<p>The religion of Farree is exclusively Mahomedan,
as is also that of more than three-fourths of the
towns and villages of the province of Efat, all of
which are under the hereditary viceregal Wallasmah,
who boasts a descent from the famous Mahomed
Grahnè, the Adal conqueror of many portions of the
ancient Abyssinian empire, in the sixteenth century.
Efat forms a portion of the valley country, or Argobbah,
which extends from the edge of the table
land of Shoa to the Hawash, that flows along
the base of this slope, from the south towards the
north. The northern boundary of Efat is the river
Robee, the southern one being the Kabani; both
of them flow into the Hawash.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the 30th of May, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_043">43</span>
messenger returned from Angolahlah, with orders
from the King that I should be allowed to proceed
thither, and that the stores should be conveyed to
his presence. Considerable bustle and confusion
seemed thereupon to take possession of the previously
quiet town. Vociferous proclamations were
from time to time issued by the misselannee in
person, standing upon the stone enclosure in the
centre of the market-place. Numerous informants,
willing to be the first bearers of good news, hurried
to acquaint us with the cause of all the stir, and to
assure us that we were to start in the morning; for
that the requisite permission had arrived from the
King, and the Wallasmah had directed our mules
to be brought in from the grazing ground. The
proclamations of the misselannee were to the effect
that all persons owing suit and service to the Wallasmah,
on account of land held of him, must
present themselves; and either personally, or by their
slaves, convey the boxes and other packages as far
as Aliu Amba, on the road to Angolahlah, from
which town a relief party would then take the duty
of carrying them the remaining distance.</p>

<p>From the character of the road, badly constructed
and in wretched condition, all the
packages had to be conveyed up the long ascent to
Shoa upon the shoulders of men. Besides, the only
beasts of burden, except an occasional worn-out
mule or horse, employed by the Abyssinians, are
asses, and these were found to be unequal to the
carriage of large angular-formed boxes, which, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_044">44</span>
fact, could not have been properly secured upon the
backs of these little animals.</p>

<p>In the evening the Hy Soumaulee came to bid
me good-bye, objecting to the cold of Angolahlah,
when I asked them if they did not intend to visit
me there. They shuddered at the thought of it,
and all business transactions, as regarded payment
for their services, were referred to the agency of
the two heads of the Kafilah, Ohmed Mahomed
and Ebin Izaak, who were obliged, of course, to
present themselves to the Negoos Sahale Selassee,
and to the British ambassador.</p>

<p>I saw them depart with feelings of regret
that I had no means in my power to reward
the services of these faithful, and I will add,
attached Bedouins; beyond bearing testimony
to the great capabilities of their people, who are
possessed certainly of the greatest virtues and of
the noblest attributes of our nature, if judged
by the standard of human excellence contained in
the Iliad or Æneid, the heroes of which I would
undertake to match with many Dankalli warriors of
the present day. During my stay in this town, it
was customary for them to come from Channo,
where they were quartered, to sit with me an hour
or so in the cool of the morning or the evening.
On these occasions their appearance always gave
me pleasure, bursting into sight all at once as they
chased each other over the crest of the hill, their
dark forms for a moment boldly relieved upon the
bright sky behind them; down they would come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_045">45</span>
full speed along the tortuous, but easy sloping
descent across the market-place and up the low
bank to my residence, shouting as they came,
“Ahkeem, ahkeem,” to give me notice of their
approach. On entering, four or five of them, with
their usual impetuosity, would extend their hands
for the sliding contact with the palm of mine, at
the same time calling out together the oft-repeated
expression, “Negarsee,” or “Myhisee,” which respectively
characterizes the evening or morning
salutation.</p>

<p>It was after sunset of the last day we were
at Farree, before the Wallasmah sent for us to
communicate the pleasure of the King, or Negoos,
as I shall call him for the future. We were
ordered to proceed to Angolahlah; and whilst we
were talking, our mules were brought up and
delivered over to Mr. Scott’s servants, that we
might start as early as we pleased the next morning.
The Wallasmah also was ordered to attend at
Angolahlah, which was one reason of his having
withheld the information of our departure from us
until the last moment. The summons which he
was obliged to obey did not exactly accord with his
wishes, and a two days’ journey for an old man of
sixty years of age, we admitted was a sufficient
reason for the increased ill-temper with which he
received the causers of so much trouble when we
visited him on the last occasion. I took with me
another pound of gunpowder and some more
coloured cotton cloth; and these had the good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_046">46</span>
effect of restoring him to perfect good humour:
indeed, to show his regard for us, much to our
surprise, he directed some of his attendants to
liberate the unfortunate messenger who had been
detected bringing me a letter the day before Mr.
Scott’s arrival, and who, we conceived, had returned
to Ankobar, according as had been stated on one of
our first visits by the Wallasmah himself. Instead
of this being the fact, we now found that the poor
fellow had been the whole time confined in his
thatched lock-up, and supplied with a scanty fare
of the worst kind of bread and water. I felt very
sorry for him when he came staggering out of
prison, with blood-shot eyes and squalid look; and
it was with feelings of pity rather than of contempt,
that I witnessed the broken spirited man, with
shoulders bare, and with the most abject submission,
stoop and kiss the earth at the feet of his unjust and
tyrannical oppressor. The Wallasmah, with the
penetrating glance of suspicious cunning, read in
my countenance the detestation I felt at such
unwarrantable conduct on his part, and muttered
in excuse, something about the man having been
“one of Krapf’s servants,” as if he considered that
quite a sufficient pretext for the harshest treatment.
The Mahomedans of Efat fully believe, that the
exhortations of that zealous missionary alone prevented
the Negoos from changing his religion; as,
shortly before his arrival in Shoa, a Koran and a
mollum to expound it to the Christian monarch,
had been sent for to the palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_047">47</span>
Mr. Scott and I were so astonished at seeing the
man whom we thought to be far distant, that we
could not say anything. It would have been a
great relief to my indignation if I could have told my
thoughts to the old scoundrel, but this being out of
the question, I walked away as quickly as possible
from his presence, followed by Mr. Scott and our
servants; and I do hope that our abrupt and unceremonious
departure annoyed him a little, and
thus retaliated in some measure for his contempt of,
and disrespect towards us.</p>

<p>The politic Sahale Selassee, Negoos of Shoa, is
well aware of the character of the Wallasmah, and
the value of having such an imbecile ruling over
the restless Mahomedan population of his kingdom.
A governor, indeed, of whom he may truly say, as
our Charles the Second did of himself and of his
brother the Duke of York, “That his subjects
would never kill him to make the other King.”</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Efat, much as they dislike the
opprobrious position of living under a Christian
monarch, never entertain an idea of revolting from
the Negoos to place themselves under the power of
that vindictive drunkard the Wallasmah Mahomed;
whose only claim to their respect is his religion
and his descent from the hero of modern Abyssinian
history, Mahomed Grahnè, of whose extensive
kingdom of Adal this little province of
Efat, not so large as Middlesex, is all that has
remained to his family, and even that is now a
portion of the Christian state of Shoa.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>May 31st.</i>—Long before the sun had appeared
upon the horizon our mules were saddled and
bridled; the hotel bill for Mr. Scott and myself
duly discharged, by a present of two dollars to the
owner of the house where we had been entertained
and imprisoned; farewells were exchanged for the
last time with some of my Kafilah friends, and of
my escort; and we were off on our journey to
Angolahlah, just as the distant elevated hills
near Ankobar, and the ridge or line of the table
land of Shoa beyond these, were brightly gilded
by the first rays of the rising luminary. Steadily
we descended the loose stony declivity of the hill
of Farree, then clattered more briskly along a
winding road that, taking us round the base of a
much higher eminence, shut us out entirely from
the sight of the white tobed townspeople, who sat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_049">49</span>
along the edges of their own cliffs to watch our
progress so far on our journey.</p>

<p>We now descended a bank of about four feet
high into the bed of the stream, by whose denuding
agency the rocky flanks of the adjoining hills
had been laid bare. Trees of irregular height, and
of very various foliage, bordered the broad pebbly
channel, along which a gently rippling brook
meandered, its course opposed to ours as it flowed
to join the Hawash. Sometimes it scoured a little
ledge of gravel, or fell over and among high
boulders, the evidences of its power in the time of
its fullest might, during the heavy rains of July and
August; when its swollen volume, yellow with
suspended mud, rushes along its then pent-up
bounds, bearing before it rocks, uprooted trees,
and the rotting debris of jowarhee, beans, or teff,
from the upland fields which it has devastated in
its course.</p>

<p>We rode for some time along the bed of the
stream, following its serpentine channel, until we
turned upon its right bank, and began to ascend a
long gradual slope, which having overcome, only
led us to a descent equally irksome, both to riders
and mules, from its continued inclination downwards.
At its base we crossed another stream,
and then began to climb another height, and then
came again the equally tiresome descent on the
opposite side. And thus we proceeded for at least
four hours, alternate hill and stream in regular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_050">50</span>
succession, until we arrived at Aliu Amba; a
village perched upon a flat-topped isolated rock that,
nearly at right angles with the road, juts across
the upper end of a pretty little valley, along which
we had been coming for the last half hour.</p>

<p>When we had managed to scramble over a
series of irregular and quite naturally disposed
stone steps, and had gained the level summit
of this ridge, I turned to look in the direction from
whence we had come, and contemplated it with
great satisfaction; congratulating myself at having
got two-thirds of the heavy business over of ascending
the long flight of hill steps which, gradually
increasing in elevation, form a kind of giant staircase
from our starting place at Farree to the table
land of Shoa.</p>

<p>At Aliu Amba we met numbers of Christian
Abyssinians, and were taken to the house of the
Governor, also a Christian, but who was absent in
attendance upon the King. Every civility was
paid to us, and numerous were the inquiries made
after Lieut. Barker, who, it appears, had taken up
his residence in this town some months previous to
his return journey. I was glad to be able to say
that I had had a personal interview with him, for
I could see, that to be the “Woodage Kapitan,”
friend of the Captain, as he was called in Shoa,
was a great recommendation; and although a
lengthened levee, with a crowd of people whose
language you cannot understand, is a terrible bore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_051">51</span>
still smiling faces, and a friendly welcome, in a
strange country, from whatever cause, does the
traveller’s heart good, and encourages him to
proceed on his undertaking.</p>

<p>We halted for nearly two hours at Aliu Amba,
not being able to get away before, as a sheep had
been killed, and our servants were determined to
take advantage of the hospitality of the townspeople.
When their hunger was satisfied, they
brought us our mules, for which we had been
asking some time in vain, as Mr. Scott and I were
anxious to breakfast, if we could, at Ankobar with
Dr. Roth, and Mr. Bernatz the artist to the Embassy,
A large concourse of the principal people
of the town accompanied us across the market-place
to the edge of their little table hill, from
whence they watched us until shut out from view
by the sinuosity of the narrow road, which occupied
the summit of a ledge separating the slopes of
two small rivulets, running in opposite directions
around the hill of Aliu Amba, to join each other
in the valley in front.</p>

<p>We now rode between two delightful natural
hedge rows of a low thorny bush with dark green
leaves, and-bearing clusters of a black sweet berry;
over which trailed in most luxuriant profusion a
very sweet scented jasmine; and pushing its way
through this mass of vegetation, high above all,
flowered the common hedge rose of England. Its
well-remembered delicately blushing hue, so unexpectedly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_052">52</span>
greeting me here, elicited a feeling that,
with but a little more ardent sensitiveness in my
nature, would have thrown me on my knees before
it, as Linnæus is said to have knelt to the flowering
furze, on first witnessing its brilliant blossoms in
England.</p>

<p>The road now became most shockingly stony,
strewed with detached fragments of the cliffs
around, as we approached the bluff termination
of the table land above us. A recent earthquake
had brought down considerable quantities,
and no attempt had been made to remove the
blocks, travellers very patiently seeking out a new
path around them. In two or three places, where
the <i lang="fr">detour</i> was too great, some desperate spirits
had forced their mules or donkeys to breast up the
miniature precipices a few feet in height. At one of
these situations I dismounted, preferring to walk
through the delightfully hanging gardens on either
side of me, and along an embowered lane, where a
dense shade, and numberless little streams that
traversed sometimes considerable distances, contributed
to the agreeable coolness of an elevation
between 6,000 and 7,000 feet above the level of
the sea. Here, as everywhere else, where trees
abounded, birds of all characters and colours gave
liveliness to the scene. One similar in size and
plumage to our sparrow, constructed pensile nests,
dropping as it were from the extreme boughs that
nodded with these novel appendages. The dove,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_053">53</span>
slattern as she is, here also built her nest, a ragged
stage of sticks; whilst in the thick bush beneath,
the prying traveller could detect the round
black speaking eye of some other little expectant
mother of the feathered race, as, with head
thrown aside, she confidingly and instinctively
expects that the goodness of man’s nature will not
allow him to disturb her sacred functions; a pleasing
testimony it is to me, nature’s own evidence of
the primitive excellence of man, when he and all
around were pronounced by the Creator to be
good.</p>

<p>Very soon tiring, however, in my weak state and
on such a road, I got on to my mule again, which,
if she could have spoken, would certainly have
echoed the sentiment of the Portuguese traveller,
Bermudez, who, in the 16th century, describing
the very same road, represents it as giving him an
idea of those in hell, from its steepness and roughness.
Our poor animals, in fact, were frequently
obliged to come to a stand-still to recover their
breath; but they soon set their faces to the steep
rocks, and managed, in some way or other, to
surmount many very queer-looking places, without
shedding us into some uncomfortably deep water-cut
precipices that, as we got nearer to the end of
our journey, began to be exchanged for the verdant
hedges of the previous portion. The whole way
we were constantly encountering herds of donkeys,
heavily laden with grain, which was being brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_054">54</span>
down from the high land to be exchanged in Efat
for cotton and salt. The men who accompanied
them were, to my surprise, much darker coloured
than the people of the lower country, tall, well
made, and armed with spear and shield. With
loud cries they encouraged the patient animals
before them, to quicken their slow and cautious
pace down the stony descent. The friendly salutation
as we passed was never forgotten, nor did the
laughing fast-talking girls who accompanied them
spare their smiles, which was quite a merciful dispensation,
that made our difficult and fatiguing
ascent, much pleasanter than would have been a
macadamized road through a desert.</p>

<p>We at length reached a narrow tortuous ridge
of at least a mile in length, across which, a walk of
but a few yards presented to the view on either
side, a deep and extensive valley. That on the left
hand is by far the narrower and more precipitous,
being bounded by the steep, almost perpendicular
face of the opposite ridge of Tchakkah, at the
distance of about four miles; whilst that on the
right, is of a character exactly the reverse, a widely
extending amphitheatrical formed valley spreading
from below the feet, far towards the east.</p>

<p>From the summit of an inclined plane, eight
thousand feet above the level of the sea, the eye
travels for sixty miles over hundreds of little hills,
embosomed in the widely diverging arc that defines
the bay-like valley, in which is contained the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_055">55</span>
of the numberless streams that, joining the
small river Dinkee near to Farree, flow into
Lee Adu. This lake formed a bright feature of the
scene, embosomed in the dark green belt of forest
that marks the course of the Hawash; beyond
which the sandy plains of Adal, blending with a
colourless sky, constituted an horizon in which
sight was lost.</p>

<p>Between the two strongly contrasted yet equally
beautiful scenes I could have oscillated the whole
day, had not I been reminded by Mr. Scott that
breakfast would be waiting for us at Ankobar. At
this touching appeal I urged on my mule, who
now rested herself by a gallop along the very level
summit of the ridge that, like a natural suspension
bridge, is extended from the hill of Ankobar in
the west to that of Lomee on the south, and forms
the boundary between these bearings of the upper
portion of the Dinkee valley.</p>

<p>In two or three places I noticed that the otherwise
narrow ridge spread out into little flats of
about fifty yards across. As we passed the first of
these, a small heap of stones, surmounted by a
rude wooden cross, indicated to the passer-by that
a church was hidden in the grove of kolqual and
wild fig-trees that occupied the limited expansion.
Each of Mr. Scott’s servants most reverentially dismounted
to kiss the topmost stone, on which the
cross stood. A little beyond, the road again contracted,
and from the back of my mule, by merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_056">56</span>
turning my face, I could look into either valley on
my right or left hand. Along this path we proceeded
cautiously in Indian file, passing in one
place the site of a devastated grove and ruined
church; the scarping effects of constant land-slips
on either side the ridge having in this position
defeated all efforts of man to prevent the destruction
of the sacred edifice, its site having been
gradually removed during the process of denudation
which is so rapidly altering the physical
features of this country. The eastern face of the
hill of Ankobar was now before us, the head of a
subordinate valley scooped out of that side of the
ridge only intervening. Having doubled this by
continuing along our level road, we scrambled over
a rough precipitous ascent, fortunately only of a
few yards in extent, and entered a narrow lane or
street between high banks, on which stood a
number of straggling thatched round houses, each
in its own enclosure. The road appeared to have
been worn into a hollow way by the constant
passage of man and beast during the many reigns
since this hill became a royal residence.</p>

<p>Tradition asserts, and I believe Abyssinian recorded
history affirms, that the first occupier of this commanding
height was a Galla Queen called Anko, and by
the addition of “bar”(door) to her name, native philologists
(and they are very curious in these matters)
have determined the designation of this town to
be, significant of its having been the gate or door
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_057">57</span>
of Anko. This is rather an unfinished interpretation,
as it omits to tell us what it secured; and
were it not that we had the circumstantial evidence
that the town stands upon the height commanding
the only road leading from the low countries to the
table land of Shoa, we should be at a loss for the
real reason of its very apt name, which it must be
allowed to be when that circumstance of situation
is known.</p>

<p>After threading our way for at least a quarter of
an hour through a labyrinth of high over-hanging
banks, topped by ragged hedges, or grey moss-covered
palings of splintered fir, we at length
reached a large oblong or rather oval building, for
one continuous circuit of a wattled wall offered no
angles to determine sides. This was covered by an
ample straw roof, with far-projected eaves, and
having two bright red earthenware pots at the extremities
of the crest of the roof, as a finish to the
whole. This was the British Residency, and gladly
we dismounted to meet our expected friends.
Turning aside the green Chinese blind, which,
suspended from the top of the entrance, was sufficient
to exclude the beggars, and yet admitted
some light into the interior, we gained admittance;
and having passed through a large central apartment,
where mules, horses, and sheep were stabled,
I was conducted into a clay-plastered apartment,
about six feet by nine, between the inner and outer
walls of the building, where I found two gentlemen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_058">58</span>
belonging to the Mission, Dr. Roth, the naturalist,
and Mr. Bernatz, the artist, just about to commence
their breakfast.</p>

<p>Greetings and congratulations were exchanged,
and numberless inquiries made about the cause of
my detention at Farree. A host of idle Abyssinian
servants gathered around, questioning in like
manner the native servants of Mr. Scott, and it
was sometime before we settled down to partake
of the good things which Constantine, the Portuguese
cook, during the bustle of our arrival, had
taken the opportunity to prepare.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott and I having determined to hurry
on the same day to Angolahlah, fresh mules
were ordered to be ready by the time I had
sufficiently indulged in the luxury of something
like English fare, which, for the first time for
nearly three months, was now placed before me.</p>

<p>When we started, Mr. Scott volunteered to be
guide, and so excused his servants from being
dragged on such an unnecessary journey. Having
got through the town of Ankobar, we began to
descend, progressing more rapidly after passing
some distance along the side of a high stockade
surrounding the royal residence, which occupied
the whole summit of the partially detached western
extremity of the ridge on which Ankobar stands.
The descent continued for nearly half an hour, the
road being exceedingly rough and stony, until
we came to the edge of the little river Airahra,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_059">59</span>
flowing into the Hawash, the stream of which
by its denudation has cut from the table-land of
Tchakkah, the long narrow ridge which we passed
along during the ride to Aliu Amba.</p>

<p>Formerly the Airahra flowed into the Barissa, and
was a tributary therefore of the mighty Nile; but a
singular natural operation has effected an alteration
in its course, and it now flows in an opposite
direction. Physical geography, I think, does not
describe a similar character of country as the surface
of the table land of Abyssinia presents, or the
relative position it occupies in consequence with
surrounding countries. These must both be treated
of before I can give the reader the manner in
which nature is gradually effecting what former
Abyssinian monarchs threatened to do, the turning
of the waters of the Nile from the direction of
Egypt and the north, to the Indian Ocean and
the East. A mighty operation which is most
certainly going on, and which can be demonstrated,
will in the end drain the northern portion of
Abyssinia, by a communication being opened
between the river Hawash and the Abi, or Bruce’s
Nile. In this place, however, any description
would fail in the effect of conveying a clear idea
to the mind of the reader; but in a future page,
when more familiar with the country he is now
travelling over with me, I will endeavour fully to
explain the manner in which this curious process
of natural engineering is being carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_060">60</span>
We forded the Airahra a little beyond a square
stone building with a thatched roof, which was
pointed out to me as the water mill, that was
erected by the two Armenians whom I met in
Tajourah, Demetrius and Joannes. Whatever
ability was displayed in the construction, but little
judgment had been exercised in its situation, for
it stood at the bottom of a deep valley, at the
distance of two miles at least, by the circuitous
and rugged road, from the town of Ankobar:
whilst, on the other side, to look up the ascent
of the Tchakkah would have certainly occasioned
the fall behind of the cap from off the head.</p>

<p>I do not believe the architects built it for any
direct purposes of utility, but to give the Negoos
an idea of their mechanical skill. It is now
unemployed, if we believe some travellers, by
reason of the Jinn or demons, by whose power
they say the Shoans believe the mill was put in
motion. This assertion is of the same character
with that which represents Sahale Selassee putting
reverentially a pair of vaccine glasses into an amulet,
mistaking the instructions given for their proper
use, when it is notorious that for a great number
of years the analogous operation of inoculation
has been practised in Shoa. I can only say, that
when windmills were described as being much
better adapted for the purposes of a people who
principally inhabit the summits of hills, Sahale
Selassee so admired the idea that I was almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_061">61</span>
afraid I should be obliged to construct one. So
far from the monarch supposing mills to be worked
by demons, he never troubled himself so much, in
a conversation with me, as he did to shew how
closely he had observed every part of the mill that
had been put up, to learn its economy, and the
manner in which its effects were produced.</p>

<p>The most laborious employment of the women of
Abyssinia is grinding flour. Windmills to perform
this duty would diminish considerably the demand
for female slaves in that country, and less encouragement
would be, therefore, given to the internal
slave-trade of Africa, whilst the prohibition of the
export of slaves by Mahomedans from the eastern
coast, would extinguish the greater part of the
infernal traffic at once.</p>

<p>Immediately after crossing the Airahra we
commenced a most villanous ascent. I believe
that, to be in daily use, and traversed by hundreds
of individuals, the Tchakkah road is unequalled in
the world for steepness, roughness, and everything
else that can contribute to make a road difficult and
unsafe. Now a brawling stream, rushing down into
the Airahra, covers with a slippery slime the bald
face of the rock; here loose crumbling stones
treacherously detach themselves from beneath the
struggling hoofs of the mule; and there an actual
cataract, of at least eight feet high, has to be
scrambled over, splashing through spray and the
flying gravel dislodged by the ascent. Zigzag
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_062">62</span>
parallels, as they are termed in fortifications, are
the exact description of the route we took up the
almost perpendicular cliffs; and our faces were
alternately turned nearly due north and south, as
we succeeded in accomplishing some ten or twelve
yards in the traverse, at every turn we made,
peeping over into a deep abyss that yawned before
us, and prevented our ride from being extended
longer in that direction. Often does the merciful
man here dismount from his tired mule, and
sitting upon some detached portion of rock, congratulate
himself, as he gazes downward, on
having effected so much of his painful task; and
as he looks upward receives some encouragement
to proceed, when he sees the reward of perseverance,
in the distant image of some preceding
traveller gradually rising in relief against the sky,
then suddenly disappearing over the lofty ridge
where terminates his labour.</p>

<p>It took us one hour to surmount this awful
steep, which, had it been some thousand feet
higher, might not, perhaps, have been unjustly
compared with similar passes among the Alps; but
even then the comparison would hold no longer
than the ascent, for, arrived upon the summit, the
stranger finds no descent but an extensive table land
spread before him, and he cannot divest himself of an
idea, that he has reached some new continent. A
Scotch climate, and Scotch vegetation, wheat,
barley, and linseed, and yet still in inter-tropical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_063">63</span>
Africa; he feels as if there must be some mistake,
an idea of incongruity, not unlike what I experienced
upon seeing in a “united family of animals,”
several rats seeking a warm retreat beneath the
fur of a cat. Everything, in fact, was different
to what I had expected, and the nearly black skins
of the natives that we met seemed to be unnatural
in a country where a chill breeze was
blowing.</p>

<p>Koom Dingi, the resting-stone, is a solitary
remaining hexagonal prism of grey columnar porphyry,
some few feet in height, and stands amidst
the fragments of others, very conspicuously on the
extreme edge of the Tchakkah. Here it is usual for
the weary wayfarer after his ascent, to stop and refresh
himself with the bread no Abyssinian on a long
journey fails to provide himself with, and carries
wrapt up in the long mekanet, or girdle, that
surrounds his loins.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott and myself, however, pushed on our
mules, glad at having got over the worst part of the
road to Angolahlah, and willing to make the best
of our way before sunset, for it began to be a question
with my companion, if we should arrive before
night at our destination.</p>

<p>The country seemed highly cultivated, wheat
and barley on all sides growing close to our path;
but no trees or hedge rows enlivened with their
verdure or fragrance, the bleak, moor-like scene
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_064">64</span>
around. The farm-houses were few and far
between, neither were they so high nor so comfortable-looking
as those of the clustered villages, that
crowned every little hill in the vale of the Dinkee,
on the other side of Ankobar. The walls were
generally a circle of rough, unhewn stones, about
three feet high, supporting the usual conical roof of
straw. The smoke escaped in white wreaths from
beneath the eaves, or issued in a volume from
the entrance, and had it not been for some
substantial and really English-looking stacks of
grain standing near, which prevented the idea of
poverty being connected with the apparent discomforts
of these dwellings, the name of hovels would
have been far too superior a designation for them.</p>

<p>We met very few people on the road, but these
had all of them a great number of questions to put,
if we would have stayed to listen. We were also
several times called upon to stop for the night
at the houses of people who ran after us to say,
that they knew Mr. Krapf, and that, consequently,
we must be their friends, and partake of their hospitality.
Although shivering with cold, and nearly
tired out, we resisted all such temptations, proceeding
at a gentle amble, for which the mules of Shoa
are famous, and after a long ride of seven hours,
just as the sun was setting, its last rays falling upon
our faces, the straggling but extensive town of
Angolahlah suddenly opened upon us, as we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_065">65</span>
rounded the low shoulder of a ridge which had
been in sight for nearly the last hour.</p>

<p>Three extensive, but low hills of nearly equal
height, and covered with houses, enclose a triangular
space, which forms the centre of the town. Across
this, Mr. Scott and I quickly galloped our mules,
pulling up opposite a white square tent, at the door
of which had already appeared Capt. Harris and
Capt. Graham, the news of our approach having
been conveyed by a forerunner, who had observed
us in the distance.</p>

<p>A very pleasant evening followed; conversation
upon home and Indian news occupied the few
hours before we retired to rest; and amidst the
luxuries and conveniences, so abundantly supplied
to the Embassy by the indulgent care of a liberal
Government, I almost fancied that I had returned to
the pleasures and comforts of civilized life. As my
cloak, coats, and carpet, which constituted my bed,
were left at Farree, my courteous entertainer, Capt.
Harris, supplied me with an abundance of warm
clothing for the night, and I slept well in an adjoining
tent, of black worsted-cloth, manufactured by
the Abyssinians.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, amidst all his kindness, Capt.
Harris considered it to be his duty to take notes of
my conversation, without my being aware in the
slightest degree of such a step, or being conscious
of the least necessity for his doing so. On my
becoming aware of this circumstance, a few weeks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_066">66</span>
after, by the distortion of a most innocent remark
of mine, which was imputed to me in a sense that
I never dreamt of employing it, I retorted in a
manner that led to further proceedings; and
from that time all intercourse between the members
of the Embassy and myself ceased for some
months.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>June 1st.</i>—This morning Capt. Harris and Mr.
Scott were busily engaged writing a strong remonstrance
to the King upon the subject of the detention
of the latter in Farree, and the seizure by the
Wallasmah, of the despatches and stores. I had
waived all consideration of the indignities offered
to myself, as I saw that from some inexplicable
reason Capt. Harris wished to restrict the letter to
a notice of the imprisonment of Mr. Scott; although
I was rather surprised that the letter which was
written in English should be taken by that gentleman
himself, with a Persian interpreter, who spoke
Amharic very imperfectly, to explain it. However,
they did not see the Negoos, and beyond the letter
being duly entered in the record-book of the
Embassy, no other steps were taken on account of
the infraction of the commercial treaty which had
been entered into between Sahale Selassee, Negoos
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_068">68</span>
of Shoa, and Capt. Harris, the representative of
Her Majesty at that court.</p>

<p>During the three succeeding days, numerous
bearers brought to Angolahlah the stores from
Farree, and by orders of the Negoos all were
deposited in the palace-yard, nor was one allowed
to be touched or seen by our Ambassador. All
this time I amused myself as well as I could, reading
some volumes upon African discoveries; sometimes
taking a short walk along a narrow flat
through which a little meandering stream flowed
directly to the Lomee Wans, or Lemon river, which
has cut a deep and wide ravine in front of the
village of Tcherkos, celebrated as being the scene
of a dreadful massacre of Christians by a rebel
governor of Shoa, named Matoka, some few years
before. This ravine extends from the south, in a
direction towards the north-east, and joins, or is
continuous with that to the west of the town of
Debra Berhan, where the Barissa, in its course to
the Jumma, forms, in the rainy season, some magnificent
waterfalls.</p>

<p>Some idea of the depth to which even these early
tributaries of the Abi (Bruce’s Nile) have denuded
their channels may be derived from the fact, that
the little stream, along the banks of which I used
to direct my steps, after a course of scarcely two
miles, leaps down, in one unbroken fall, seven hundred
feet to join the rivulet below, for the Lomee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_069">69</span>
Wans deserves no higher title. I can easily comprehend,
therefore, the astonishing fact that after
flowing the short distance of two hundred and fifty
miles, the river Abi should be found by Dr. Beke
not more than three thousand feet above the level
of the sea, although flowing through a table land,
the general elevation of which exceeds nine thousand
feet.</p>

<p>On the fourth morning of my stay at Angolahlah,
a page came from the King to desire Capt. Harris
to attend at the palace. Shortly after this was
complied with, another summons arrived for one of
the soldiers, who was employed as a carpenter, to
follow also. In about half an hour, the whole
party returned, the interpreter, Ibrahim, carrying
in his cloak the torn-up, tarpaulin-covered packages
of letters. I now learnt that the Negoos had commanded
that the boxes and other things should be
burst open in his presence. This arbitrary command
being immediately complied with, after the
first few were examined, he graciously gave permission
for the whole to be removed to the tents of
the Embassy, being satisfied with the willingness
shown to gratify him in his most unreasonable
demands. This humiliating concession, I am convinced,
would not have been required had not the
monarch felt some jealous misgivings as to the
amount of prerogative he had curtailed himself of
by attaching his signature to the treaty of commerce;
the first fruits of which had been the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_070">70</span>
impolitical letter of remonstrance on a previous
occasion; the innocent writer of which, Mr.
Krapf, had already been made to feel the kingly
resentment by the ill-usage that gentleman received
from the chief, Adara Billee, when he endeavoured
to return to Shoa, after an unsuccessful attempt
to reach the city of Gondah.</p>

<p>For the future, I shall endeavour to relate the
incidents of my residence in Shoa, with as little
allusion to politics as possible, but the reader must
excuse the few remarks I have already made, convinced
as I am, that the physical failure of the
expedition on the western coast of Africa, under
Capt. Trotter, is much less to be regretted, than
the great moral injury the cause of African civilization
and English influence in that continent
have sustained by the incapability of one man,
and the ill-judged proceedings which characterized
his ambassadorial career. I am not the proper
person, however, to sit in judgment upon any one;
but I know from personal experience, that as
regards Southern Abyssinia, the merchant and the
missionary must now seek other situations for
carrying out their interesting and philanthropic
projects for the regeneration of Africa.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_071">71</span>
I found the weather so exceedingly cold, and the
time at Angolahlah pass so uselessly and heavily
along, that I was very glad, after a week’s stay, to
be again on the road back to Ankobar. The day
previous to my leaving Angolahlah, I engaged a
servant, named Walderheros, tall, athletic, but of
most ill-favoured countenance, so much so, that
“Gool,” to which eastern vampire he was compared
by the members of the Mission, became his cognomen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_072">72</span>
afterwards amongst them. My mule being
saddled, we started early in the morning, as I was
desirous of getting as far on the road as possible
before the sun had ascended so high as to render the
ride unpleasantly warm. Walderheros trudged along
on foot by the side of my mule, carrying my carabine
behind his neck, with his two hands resting upon
the projecting portions on either side. He talked
incessantly, and it did not seem to matter the least,
that I could not understand a word he said. To
check him, I repeated, with a very grave face, the
whole of “My name is Norval.” He listened
patiently to the end, and it then seemed to strike
him that we should amuse ourselves much better, if
he were to teach me in his own language the names
of surrounding objects, rather than listen to such
another long rigmarole I was also about to treat him
with. Thereupon commenced my first Amharic
lesson, and as I was a willing pupil, and Walderheros
an untiring teacher, I made great progress
during the ride.</p>

<p>In this manner we travelled at a slow pace along
the undulating broad highroad that, nearly in a
direct line, conducts us from Angolahlah to the
edge of Tchakkah. We met some few travellers,
who, as we passed, exchanged loud and long-continued
salutations with Walderheros, kept up until
they were out of all convenient speaking distance
of each other. A moor, or extensive downs, would
convey the best idea of the country around; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_073">73</span>
though no trees or bushes intercept the sight, the
whole surface was well cultivated with wheat and
barley, or preserved as grazing meadows for the
feeding of cattle. Excepting one considerably
excavated valley, two or three miles from Tchakkah,
the original level of the table land is only altered
in the places where it is traversed by shallow water-denuded
channels, along which very frequently the
road runs, and the traveller proceeds in a broad
hollow way, the flat ridges on each side of him
rising some ten or twenty feet above his head.</p>

<p>I was not sorry at seeing again the already
familiar land-mark, Koom Dingi, although it
reminded me of the steep descent beyond. On
arriving at the edge of the table land, I followed
the advice of Walderheros, and dismounted; for
however sure-footed in such perilous descents mules
may be, they sometimes slip, as was evidenced by
the dead body of one that lay burst among the
rocks below, from a slip over one of the precipices.
I sat down a few minutes whilst my servant ran to
a house in sight, and procured for me the loan of a
long slender staff, of some tough wood, like a spearshaft,
which the Shoans generally carry with them
when travelling on foot. By the aid of this, I was
enabled to get along pretty well, dropping carefully
from one huge stone to another, and in this manner,
by rough unequal steps, succeeded at length in
reaching the stream of the Airahra. I now
mounted again, and forded the stony bed of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_074">74</span>
stream, surmounting with some difficulty the miry
bank on the farther side, where the deeply-sunken
hoofs of my mule were pulled with successive
snatches out of the soughing tenacious mud.</p>

<p>Half an hour’s ride brought me to the foot of the
royal hill of Ankobar. As we ascend, the road
passes midway along its steep side, which above
and below the traveller slopes several hundred feet.
Here we encountered a noisy crowd of chatting
romping girls, with large jars slung between their
shoulders by a leathern belt, or rope, which passes
across the breast. They were proceeding to a
meadow below, to fill their jars with water at a
little clear stream that fell over a little ledge of
stones as it proceeded to join the Airahra. As I
passed them, I overheard some of them whispering
to the other, “Missela Zingero,” a most complimentary
speech certainly, meaning nothing less
than that I was “like a baboon.” These girls were
slaves of the Negoos, and their chief employment
consisted of this daily duty of carrying water from
the stream to the palace on the summit of the hill.
No less than two hundred are so employed, and
these supply all the water required for the use of
the courtiers and guests, besides a body-guard of
three hundred gunmen, all of whom are daily fed
at the royal table.</p>

<p>On my arrival at the Residency, I was again
entertained by Dr. Roth and Mr. Bernatz, who,
during the four days I spent with them were as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_075">75</span>
kind and as attentive as possible. At the end of
that time I became much alarmed at feeling the
approach of symptoms threatening a return of the
intermittent fever, from which I had suffered so
much during the previous eight months. I was
not long in determining what course to pursue, but
resolved upon leaving Ankobar immediately, and
exchange its damp cold atmosphere for the more
genial climate of Aliu Amba.</p>

<p>In Ankobar my time was principally occupied in
receiving information respecting the character and
customs of the inhabitants of Shoa, but these I had
more opportunity subsequently of observing for
myself.</p>

<p>Respecting the slaves of the Negoos, in addition
to the water-bearers just spoken of, I learned that
he possessed several hundreds of others. All the
gunmen who constitute the body-guard are bondsmen,
and of these there are at least one thousand.
These are divided into three bodies, relieving each
other in rotation after one week’s attendance at the
palace; so that these men have entirely to themselves
two weeks out of three, a period always spent
with their families. As individuals distinguish
themselves for bravery and loyalty, they obtain
grants of houses and gardens, generally in the
immediate neighbourhood of the royal residences.
When they advance in years, or have sons old
enough to attend in their places, larger quantities
of land, apportioned according to merit, are given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_076">76</span>
to them and they become tenants of the King, only
called up for suite and service on the occasions of
the “zemitcharoitsh,” or expeditions. The grown
up sons who fill their places as guardsmen generally
reside with their fathers, and in that case their guns
are allowed to be taken home with them; but the
general rule is, that they should deposit them, after
the term of duty has expired, in the armouries
attached to the palaces, where they remain under
the charge of the Atta Habta, the chief blacksmith.
The gunmen have but one superior officer, who is
termed “Ullica,” or “Shoom.” The name of the
present colonel, if he may be so termed, is
Kattimah. By courtesy he is styled “Atta Kattimah,”
Atta being a title of distinction applied
generally to all courtiers of high rank.</p>

<p>The gunmen, whilst on duty at the palace, receive
daily two double handsful of some kind of grain or
other; a kind of admeasurement that reminded me
strongly of a similar custom of giving rations to slaves
among the ancient Romans. Beside this, however,
they get one good meal a-day at the King’s own
table; at least, in an apartment where he superintends
this diurnal feast of his attendants, who are
plentifully regaled with large teff crumpets and a
quantity of ale. With the bread is always provided
some cayenne paste, called “dillock,” composed
of equal parts of the red pods of the pepper
and common salt, mixed with a little “shrow,” or
the meal of peas. This is placed in a number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_077">77</span>
of saucers of red earthenware, which stand in the
middle of oblong tables of wicker work, about one
foot and a-half high. A number of these are placed
in the form of a horse-shoe in the banquetting-room,
and around, on both sides, sitting upon
the ground, the gunmen range themselves, sometimes
in double ranks. The King presides over all,
reclining upon a yellow satin-covered couch, in a
kind of recess, or alcove in one side of the apartment.
The greatest order and decorum is preserved,
but no restraint appears to be laid either
upon appetite or quiet conversation.</p>

<p>Upon occasions of festivals, which are exceedingly
numerous, an unlimited amount of raw meat is added
to their usual fare. Slave boys carry about a large
lump of flesh, held fast over one shoulder by a strong
grip of both hands, whilst each of the dining party
cuts with his knife such portion he may desire, and
then dismisses the boy with his blessing to the next
who requires a like uncooked steak. In addition
to their entertainment by the King when on duty
at the palace, the gunmen receive a monthly pay of
from three to seven ahmulahs, or salt-pieces, according
to their length of service. Besides the numerous
gunmen who are generally slaves born in the service
of the Negoos, there is an inferior class who have
been purchased from dealers, or have come to
the King as the import duty when Kafilahs of these
unhappy creatures arrive in his dominions. The
usual “assair,” or tithe, being taken as of every other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_078">78</span>
kind of merchandize that is brought into Shoa.
These slaves are employed generally as cutters of
wood; and a most toilsome and ill-requited labour
is that which they have to perform, for the country
around Angolahlah and Debra Berhan is so bare
of wood that the inhabitants have no other resource
for fuel but the dung of cattle mixed with mire,
which are formed into large flat cakes and heaped
up in storehouses for protection from the weather.
I believe that the quantity of potass in the soil in
this part of the country, contributes considerably to
the value of this strange kind of fuel, as its combination
with sundry other elements contained in
the dung saturates the mass with saltpetre.</p>

<p>The Negoos, however, does not employ this kind
of fuel in his palaces, but is supplied by the wood-cutting
slaves with the cedar-smelling pine-tree,
called “ted,” or the more adapted for a bright warm
fire, the oil-containing wood of the wild olive-tree;
both of which grow abundantly in the forests of
Kundee and Afrabinah, that occupy the head of
some of the numerous valleys sloping towards the
Hawash, on the east of the ridge in front of Ankobar.
From these forests, the stalwart frames of the
Shankalli slaves bear long and heavy burdens
of the rended fire-wood up the steep rugged
ascent, to the right of the Hill of Grace; and then,
for twenty-five miles, to the palaces of Debra
Berhan and Angolahlah. Upon this painful and
laborious duty, not less than three hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_079">79</span>
slaves are employed, who receive daily the most
wretched fare, either a few handsful of parched
wheat, or else, the sour and coarse refuse from the
gunmen’s table. Still, these, I found, were far from
being over-worked; for three days are allowed to
each for the conveyance of the load, and the return
back from the distant palaces to their homes, which
even these are provided with for themselves and
their families.</p>

<p>The female slaves are still more numerous;
independent of the two hundred employed in
supplying the King’s household with water, there
are, at least, one hundred more, who assist in
grinding flour, brewing, and making the “dillock,”
or pepper-paste.</p>

<p>There are, however, belonging to this class, a
more interesting party of female slaves, who are
kept in the strictest seclusion; for Sahale Selassee,
a descendant of Solomon, continues, as regards
his wives and concubines, the customs of his
ancestor’s court. Two hundred of these young
ladies are placed in charge of several eunuchs, and
the establishment, in fact, corresponds in every
respect with the hareem of an oriental monarch.
It is not very easy to obtain information respecting
the habits or occupations of these immured
beauties; but the more elaborately-spun cotton
thread, that is used for the finer descriptions of
cloths, which are presented by the Negoos to his
greatest favourites and governors, is all made by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_080">80</span>
the members of this portion of the royal household.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The large and fine cloth, valued in Shoa at
thirty dollars, sent by Sahale Selassee, as a present
to our Queen, is woven of thread spun in the
palace of Debra Berhan; and the monarch, sole
visitor to the apartments occupied by these royal
cotton-spinners, has no doubt frequently stimulated
his favourite slaves to more careful efforts, as they
produced the finely long-drawn thread, by dwelling
upon the munificence and wealth of his Egyptian
sister, our own well-beloved Sovereign.</p>

<p>Besides learning some little of the condition of
the slaves belonging to the Negoos of Shoa, whilst
in Ankobar, I also read a considerable portion of
“Ludolph’s Ethiopic History,” a work left in
charge of Dr. Roth, the naturalist of the British
Embassy, by Mr. Krapf, when he returned to
Egypt. I had the opportunity of making use of
the whole book upon the doctrine of the Church,
contained in Ludolph; and, also, the interesting
almanac which is appended to it; but the former
is such an evident compilation of what ought to be
the faith of the Abyssinian Church, rather than
what it ever was, or is at the present day, that I
considered any abstract, or account of the Christians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_081">81</span>
of Shoa, founded upon it, would be one of the
grossest impositions that could be palmed upon the
reading public. I dare not, in fact, attempt any
elucidation of the faith professed by the Negoos
and monks of Shoa. They, certainly, have no
universal creed, nor any Articles to define what is
orthodox belief, and what is not. The chief principle
of religion with the heads of the Church in
that country seems to be, to think upon this
subject exactly as the Negoos does; for if they
do not, they are very soon considered in the light
of heretics; and how far the principles of the
Negoos accord with those of the Abune, or Bishop
of Gondah, may be judged from the fact, that he
has often been judged to be in contempt, by that
holy father, and threatened with all the terrors of
excommunication. I confess myself, therefore,
unequal to the task of giving any account of
the Christian religion in Shoa. To give a correct
one, would require a man educated entirely for the
purpose by a long study of the subject in all its
relations, as connected with the Greek Church,
and the Archbishopric of Alexandria, to enable
him to collect, compare, and arrange that chaos
of religious opinions that seem to characterize
the modern Abyssinian faith; and, more especially,
that which is professed in Shoa.</p>

<p>Tellez, in his Travels of the Jesuits in Ethiopia,
in the seventeenth century, sums up all that was
known in his time; and I do not think that any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_082">82</span>
more enlightenment has been vouchsafed since to
this benighted Church. Speaking of the proclamation
of the Emperor Socinios restoring to the
Abyssinians their ancient faith, after an unsuccessful
attempt to establish the Roman Catholic religion
among them, this author remarks, “This liberty
threw them into many errors; for being uncertain
what to believe, some of their monks
affirmed, that Christ was the Son of God,
only by grace; others, that the divinity died
with him on the cross, but that he had two
divinities, one of which died, and the other
survived; others said, one person was composed
of the two others, confounded the Divine
nature with the human; and others, being quite
puzzled, cried, ‘Christ is true God, and true man,
and it is enough to know that.’ Nor was there
less division about consecrating the cup, some
contending it could not be done with any liquor
but wine; others, that it should be water discoloured
with six or seven raisins. At length, they
agreed it should be done as was used at Alexandria;
and finding no abler person to inquire of, they put
the question to an Egyptian carpenter, who told
them, it was done there in wine; yet they resolved
it should be with water and raisins.”</p>

<p>This quotation appeared so apt and so true a
picture of the present state of Christian belief in
Shoa, that I have not hesitated to introduce it here.
I should be happy, indeed, to see demonstrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_083">83</span>
that anything consistent or universal upon that
subject is entertained; and in that case I should
not mind being told, that I had erred in my conclusions
from a want of proper knowledge upon
the subject.</p>

<p>It must be observed, however, that in matters of
Church ceremony the Shoans affect the formula of
the Alexandrian Church. But even on this subject
we find that a great schism exists, by the
contemptuous disregard of tabots, robes, and all
outward show whatever, with which the Tabeeban
sect celebrate the rites of their worship. To term
these people a sect, is not so correct, perhaps, as to
call them a caste, for all artisans in Shoa, and I
believe in other parts of Abyssinia, are so designated.
Blacksmiths, potters, carpenters, in fact,
all manufacturing artisans, are called “Tabeeb,”
and, from this circumstance, when first I heard of
their mysterious religious rites, I considered that
they would be found to be a community of Freemasons.
Even now I give them the credit of
practising the primitive customs of the early
Church of Christ, as it approaches very much to
that simple worship of God which, from the internal
evidence contained in some of the Church
letters of St. Paul, we may suppose to have distinguished
the meetings of Christians in the apostolic
age. It is from this circumstance, I connect them
in origin, singularly enough, with our institution
of Freemasonry; although the primitive purity of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_084">84</span>
their parent assemblies has been much better preserved
in the simple ceremonies practised by the
Abyssinian Tabeebs, than in the festive orgies of
the mysterious brotherhood of Europe. I quit this
subject for a time, and return to Ankobar.</p>

<p>Whilst staying with Dr. Roth, I frequently
accompanied him to a small garden attached to
the old house, where Dr. Beke resided during his
visit to Shoa. On one occasion our attendant dug
up a considerable quantity of potatoes, which had
been planted by Mr. Krapf. The seedlings had
been sent from Tigre, in northern Abyssinia, by
Mr. Isenberg, and the return crop seemed very
favourable. At present no advantage has resulted
to the natives by their introduction, for the hatred
which seemed to exist against everything English
extended even to the real benefits that were offered
to the Shoans.</p>

<p>Who can help regretting the great mistake of
the missionary, in calling political aid to his assistance,
but he erred solely by his zeal to extend his
opportunities of conferring good upon his fellow-creatures.
He grieves now for influence, founded
upon respect, that is gone for ever; and from my
heart I sympathize with him, for the utter prostration
of hope that Abyssinia should become the
centre of enlightenment for the rest of the unhappy
continent of Africa.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> I had fancied that the political tactics of the Shoan Embassy
were unparalleled in history. The “Heimskringha,” or “Chronicles
of the Kings of Norway,” record, however, a somewhat
similar display of resplendent genius:—“At this time a king
called Athelstan had taken the kingdom of England. He sent
men to Norway to King Harold with the errand that the messengers
should present him with a sword, with the hilt and handle
gilt, and also the whole sheath adorned with gold and silver and
set with precious jewels. The Ambassadors presented the sword-hilt
to the King, saying, ‘Here is a sword, which King Athelstan
sends thee, with the request that thou wilt accept it.’ The King
took the sword by the handle, whereupon the Ambassadors said,
‘Now thou hast taken the sword, according to our King’s desire,
and therefore art thou his subject, as thou hast taken his sword.’
King Harold saw now that this was a jest, for he would be subject
to no man. But he remembered it was his rule whenever anything
raised his anger to collect himself and let his passion run off, and
then take the matter into consideration coolly. Now he did so,
and consulted his friends, who all gave him the advice to let the
Ambassadors, in the first place, go home in safety.”—<cite>Mr. Laing’s
Translation.</cite></p>

<p class="footnote">This is in every particular so curiously analogous to our late
political doings in Shoa, that I could not induce myself to abstain
from inserting it here as a note. Even the hint of personal violence
in the last sentence exactly corresponded with the treatment of the
Embassy whilst in Shoa, after the ill-judged letter of remonstrance
had been sent; for had it not been for the moderation of the
offended monarch, it would indeed have been “Shanta fo, Shanta
fo,” for the whole party. It was too late to find out that Sahale
Selassee was “a novice in European diplomacy,” only when the
total failure of the Mission attested the want of tact and of all knowledge
of human nature by the parties employed by a liberal and
too indulgent Government.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The Abyssinian word for thread, “fatalah,” has something in
its sound that recalls the idea of the three spinners, typical of
man’s destiny. If, as is probable, the mythological representation
of the Greeks be of Egyptian origin, then the word “fatalah,”
may have some connexion with our word fate.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> morning, Walderheros having hired a mule
for two salt-pieces, we proceeded to Aliu Amba.
I was not sorry, on reaching the summit of the
ridge in front of Ankobar, to see again the Dinkee
vale, stretching away before me, studded with
eminences and little hill villages. As nearly as
possible in the centre of them all, was the flat
circumscribed summit of the rock of Aliu Amba,
which we did not lose sight of during the whole hour
occupied in descending to its foot. The ride was
most tiresome, but my mule had more reason to be
dissatisfied than myself, and glad she was to be at
length ascending the irregular sized steps of displaced
stones, which leads on to the little plain
before we reach the first houses in the town. Here
she broke into a gallop, and carried me unresistingly
across the market-place, and along a
narrow winding lane, with thatched houses, each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_086">86</span>
in its own snug enclosure, on either side. At the
wicket of one of these the animal stopped, and my
sudden appearance rather astonished two women
who were sitting in the door porch busily spinning
cotton. “Woi Gypt, Woi Gypt,” they repeatedly
exclaimed, as they got up from the ground, just in
time to meet Walderheros, who now came running
up. He soon explained the mistake of the mule,
and taking hold of the bridle, led her about one
hundred yards farther along the lane, to a house
the most miserable looking of any I had yet seen
in the town.</p>

<p>Here, however, I was informed Lieut. Barker
had resided for nearly four months, previously to
his return to Aden, and I had been advised, in
Ankobar, to live in the same house, at least until a
better one could be obtained from the Governor.
The landlady was a poor Mahomedan woman,
named Miriam, a widow with two children, one a
grown up youth of seventeen, named Ibrahim, and
the other a daughter, not more than three years
old.</p>

<p>Arrangements were immediately made for my
accommodation, and the news of my arrival soon
spread about the town. Numerous visitors, Christian
and Islam, thronged the entrance of the house
all day, the floor being occupied by the more influential
ones. I lay in a little recess, just long
and deep enough to receive my bedstead, a low
wooden frame, with a bottom of interlaced strips
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_087">87</span>
of hide, over which an ox skin was thrown for a
mattress.</p>

<p>With such of my new friends who could speak
Arabic, I managed to keep up something like a
conversation, and also with some Indians and
Persians, who came, among others, to pay their
respects, whom I gratified with the relation of all
the latest news from their respective countries.</p>

<p>The Governor of Aliu Amba, whose name was
Tinta, had not returned from Angolahlah, but his
misselannee, or deputy, dragged into my presence,
by the horns, a fine goat, which he requested me
to accept. Walderheros readily consented in my
name, and relieved him at once of his charge,
which was taken forthwith and slaughtered; the
Deputy-Governor being chief butcher on the occasion,
getting for his trouble the head and bowels,
which, however, were first brought into me very
dutifully, to obtain my permission for such a disposal.</p>

<p>Seeing preparations made for eating, the crowd
gradually withdrew, and with considerable natural
politeness left me alone to partake of my evening’s
meal, without interruption. Fortunately I had
brought with me, from the coast, a tea-kettle,
frying-pan, and two other vessels of tinned copper.
These now became very useful, and Walderheros
was not long in placing before me a nicely cooked
dinner of boiled meat.</p>

<p>A report of my arrival at Aliu Amba having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_088">88</span>
been carried the same evening to Channo, the next
morning I was astonished at seeing the house beset
by a number of my Hy Soumaulee friends, who,
although they were glad to see me, appeared to
be not at all satisfied with something or other.</p>

<p>As none of the Tajourah people had come with
them, I sent for an Islam sheik, Hadjji Abdullah,
who lived in the next house, to come and interpret
between us. This man, by-the-by, came from Berberah,
on the banks of the Nile, in Upper Egypt,
yet he made himself perfectly understood in the
Affah language; and I expect, therefore, that some
ethnological connexion will be found to exist
between the people of Dongola and the Dankalli
tribes, although I understand that this has been
denied by some modern travellers, on the ground,
singularly enough, of the total distinctness between
their two languages.</p>

<p>I was not much surprised to learn that the
cause of complaint among the Hy Soumaulee was,
that Ohmed Mahomed, who had received from the
British Embassy one hundred and twenty dollars,
to pay them their wages, at the rate of four dollars
each man, had thought proper to give them no
more than one each, and a small coarse cotton
cloth not the value of half a dollar. Of course the
Hy Soumaulee knew nothing of the British
Embassy; it was to me they looked for the payment
of their stipulated wages, and which, for the latter
part of our journey, I had always stated would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_089">89</span>
five dollars to each man. I recollected perfectly that
when they were first engaged I refused to sanction
more than four dollars being given, on the plea
that, perhaps, the expense I was incurring would be
objected to as unnecessary, considering that Mr.
Cruttenden had paid in Tajourah all the expenses
that we were told would be necessary upon the road.
Ohmed Mahomed, however, replied, that in case the
extra dollar should be refused, Ebin Izaak and himself
would each give half a dollar, and so make up the
five dollars per man, and I had therefore always told
the Hy Soumaulee they would receive five dollars
each. When I discovered how they had been
cheated by Ohmed Mahomed, who had actually
told them that he had not received a dollar from
the Embassy, but that the dollar he had given
to each was that one promised by himself and
Ebin Izaak, I was only surprised they did not
sacrifice me at once to their resentment. I soon
disabused them of the deceit that had been practised
upon them, and promised that, as the British
Mission would be in Ankobar in the course of two
days, I would go up and see the Ambassador on
purpose that the matter should be examined into.</p>

<p>My old escort then went away very peaceably;
but so strict are the orders of the Negoos to
prevent any strangers, more especially those coming
from Adal, to enter the kingdom without special
permission, that the arrival of the Hy Soumaulee
in Aliu Amba created quite an alarm, lest, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_090">90</span>
the one hand, they should commit violence,
although they were unarmed, except with their
heavy knives; or, on the other, that the displeasure
of the Negoos should be excited against the townspeople
for having permitted them to come into
Aliu Amba at all.</p>

<p>It was sometime before I became accustomed
to the new circumstances by which I was surrounded.
My house was merely a round shed,
having a diameter of about twelve feet, the wall of
dry sticks, five feet high, being surmounted by the
usual conical roof of thatch. Opposite to the
entrance was a slight deviation from the exact
periphery of a circle, occasioned by the recess
before mentioned, in which was contained my wide
couch. Here the wall bulged out something like
a bow window in form, and was covered by a little
elongation of the roof in that situation. Nearly in
the centre of the apartment was a dilapidated
raised ring of clay and pebbles, some five or six
inches high, and about three feet in diameter.
This formed the hearth, within which two large
stones, and the broken-off neck of an old jar,
formed a kind of tripod, that occasionally supported
a smoke-blacked earthenware “macero,” or cooking
pot, in which was being boiled either some sort of
grain or other for the family, or else the meat for
mine and Walderheros’ supper.</p>

<p>On one side, ranged along the wall, stood several
large jars, two of which, covered by gourd shell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_091">91</span>
drinking cups, contained water, whilst others,
superannuated by sundry cracks, were partly filled
with teff, or wheat. The former is the minute
seed of a kind of grass, of which is made the
bread of the temperate countries of Abyssinia, as
it flourishes best in situations between the wheat and
barley fields cultivated upon the high table land of
Shoa, and the jowarree plantations in the very low
countries on a level with the Hawash.</p>

<p>The only piece of furniture, strictly speaking, in
the house, except my bed, was a chair of the most
primitive construction, its thong-woven bottom
being scarcely six inches from the ground. It
would have been altogether a good model for some
rustic seat builder about to fit up the interior of a
garden alcove. My two boxes assisted, however, in
producing a showy effect, one of them being a
Chinese trunk, covered with bright red leather, the
other a shiny tin medicine chest, and to make them
useful as well as ornamental, they were generally
converted into seats on the occasion of any visitors
of rank calling upon me.</p>

<p>Besides these things, old red gowns of my landlady,
and some tattered grass-made baskets and
sieves used in dressing and cleaning grain, were
suspended from the projecting ends of the stick
wall, and made the interior of the house look
rather untidy.</p>

<p>Walderheros was one of the few Abyssinians I
have met who appeared to delight in cleanliness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_092">92</span>
and a pretty dust he was continually raising, by
sweeping with a large handful of well-leaved
boughs the clay floor of our residence. He
delighted also in the unholy pleasures of
the pipe, a severe rheumatism always affecting
him when he was about to indulge; and I often
smile when I think of the canting tone and long
visage with which he used to apostrophise the
inanimate object of his affections, a gourd shell
pipe, as he drew it towards him, and excused such a
dereliction of duty as a Greek Christian, upon the
plea that nothing but the smoke of tobacco could
drive out the “saroitsh,” or demons, who, according
to Abyssinian belief, affect the frame when suffering
from any disease.</p>

<p>According to a tradition of the Greek Church, it
appears that the devil paid repeated visits to Noah
when he commenced building the ark, for the
purpose of ascertaining by what means and of
what materials he constructed it. The patriarch,
however, kept his own counsel, until the devil
called to his aid the herb tobacco, with which, it
seems, he made poor Noah drunk, and whilst in
that state the enemy of mankind wormed his secret
from him. Thus assisted (for it is said Noah
became an inveterate smoker), the devil availed
himself of the darkness of night to undo all that
Noah had put together during the day, and this
was the principal cause that the building of the
ark extended over so long a period. “Ever since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_093">93</span>
that time,” saith the tradition, “God has laid a heavy
curse upon tobacco.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> If some of the precepts of
the Gospel were observed with equal veneration as
is this ridiculous story by Abyssinian Christians,
we should not have to regret the low ebb to which
our religion has been reduced in this priest-ridden,
but I must not say consequently, benighted land.</p>

<p>Walderheros, however, was a business man, and
before he sat down to smoke, he was careful to
shut out observers of the fact, by fixing in its place
the old rotten door of three or four untrimmed
trunks of small trees, tied into a kind of flat
surface by the tough bark of a species of mimosa
tree. This hung by two hinges of thongs to a
crooked door-post, and shut against the wall on the
opposite side, where its own weight kept the
entrance securely closed. When all had been
arranged satisfactorily, he would drag the clumsy
chair into a position opposite to my couch, and
sitting down with his back to the door, place the
rude pipe between his feet. Then applying his
mouth to the end of its long stem, between each
puff he would look up, to tell me in Amharic the
name of some object for me to write down, whilst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_094">94</span>
he in return would endeavour to learn their Arabic
names, which language for some reason or other,
he seemed very anxious to learn. I found afterwards
that he thought it was English, and wished
to learn something of it, on purpose to understand
me when speaking my own language, and thus
become the admiration of a circle of his acquaintance
burning with curiosity to know what I might
be saying. Walderheros was, in fact, the best
caricature I ever met of that spirit which prompts
empirics to employ unintelligible language to
increase the presumption of their extensive learning.
If any of his friends were present, I could
never get a syllable from him but one or other of
about a dozen Arabic words he had picked up.
Everything was “<i>ewah</i>” (yes) or “<i>la la</i>” (no),
and how happy he was when circumstances
admitted of his saying “<i>tahle</i>” (come), or
“<i>rah</i>” (go), and the grave satisfaction with which
he turned round to interpret to his simple gaping
companions the meaning of the conversation they
had just been treated with, was most ridiculously
absurd. When he met a real Arab it was still
better; all impatience to display his vast knowledge
of their language, every word he knew of it
would be pressed into service, whilst the wondering
auditor, who would have understood him well
enough in Amharic, with a vacant look would
probably turn to me, and say, “<i>Arder rigal
muginoon fee!</i>” (That man is a fool!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_095">95</span>
His temper, however, was provokingly good, for
besides its being a great contrast to my own, I half
suspected under such a bland exterior some deceit
must lurk, but he was a lesson in human nature,
and patient ugliness will for the future be a recommendation
to me. When illness and pain had
contrived to make me the most fretful and irritable
of mortals, how often have I been reproved, for
my unreasonable upbraidings and continually finding
fault, by his constantly mild reply, “<i>Anter gaitah</i>,”
“<i>Anter gaitah</i>” (“You are my master,” “You are
my master”.)</p>

<p>I was not unfrequently visited by venerable sheiks
and learned mollums, who, with the usual Mahomedan
assumption of superiority, squatted down upon
the boxes uninvited, and considered themselves at
liberty to beg, borrow, or steal, as opportunities
afforded, without any remonstrance from the
Feringhee they affected to patronize.</p>

<p>Although at this time the town of Aliu Amba
had a Christian governor, more than three-fourths
of its inhabitants were Mahomedans. These were
exceedingly cautious in the expression of any dislike
towards the religion of their rulers, but their
prejudice against the Christian faith only rankled
the more in their bosoms. It showed itself chiefly
in petty acts of contempt or slight that could not
well be complained of without betraying some littleness
of spirit. Many of my visitors, for example,
when they saw the body of a slaughtered sheep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_096">96</span>
hanging upon the wall, would, with the coolest
impudence imaginable, hold their noses when they
came into the house, as if it had become tainted by
being killed by Walderheros.</p>

<p>Again, they always expected to have the first
cup of coffee handed to them, and, in fact, this was
the only refreshment they ever deigned to partake
with me. When my servant complained to me
that my visitors represented this, which my politeness
in the first place had induced me to practise,
to be an acknowledgment of their superiority as
Islam believers, I soon put a stop to the mistaken
idea, and if they did not choose to take the only
cup I had, after me, they went without. It was
some time before they became reconciled to the
precedence of a Christian, even in such a trivial
matter as this. In doing as I did, there was, perhaps,
but little credit on my side, for I opposed their prejudice
from a zealous weakness that differed not
the least from the principle which had actuated
them; but the heart of man is everywhere the
same. “Thus I trample,” said Diogenes, “upon
the pride of Plato.” “With equal pride,” retorted
the insulted sage.</p>

<p>Towards evening it was usual whilst I lived at
Miriam’s, for me, attended by Walderheros, to walk
to the edge of the precipitous face, looking towards
the east, of the rock upon which Aliu Amba is
built. Here, upon a large stone, high above the
narrow winding footpath, that leads from one end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_097">97</span>
of the ridge to the other, I would sit looking upon
the narrow but fertile valley in front, formed by the
junction of the two flanking streams that nearly
encircled the hill. Numerous little tributaries on
each side had formed small pyramidal knolls, carefully
cultivated to the very tops. One in particular,
higher than the rest, was crowned with a snug-looking
village, the conical roof of the largest house
in which, pointed into an exact cone the figure of
the hill. The name of this village was Sar-amba;
the road to Ankobar skirts along its base, leaving
on the right hand the town and hill of Aliu Amba.
To the left of my position, the peak of the stateprison
hill of Gauncho, and the seat of the Wallasmah
Mahomed, was just visible over a continuous
range of hills, that diminished in elevation as they
approached nearer to the town of Farree, and
which marked very well the original level of the
once sloping talus, or scarp, which connected the
high table land of Abyssinia with the low plains
around the Hawash.</p>

<p>Whilst sitting one evening upon my usual stone,
the loud whining appeal of two turbaned dirty
figures announced the presence of begging monks,
an order very numerous in Shoa. Their long
prayer to the Almighty was still going on, and I
in utter ignorance for what purpose two robust and
healthy men could be addressing me in such a
monotonous duet. Walderheros pretended to know
nothing about them, and had it not been for some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_098">98</span>
women who stood by amusing themselves with the
appearance of the new come Gypt, or Egyptian,
the monks would have had as much chance of
obtaining alms from the rocks around me, as of
opening my heart or understanding to their appeal.
“Ahmulah, ahmulah!” cried two or three of the
women, and I then found out that I must bestow
in charity a salt piece, the name of which had
already become familiar to me.</p>

<p>Walderheros soon came back from the errand I
had sent him upon, to procure the bulky coin,
which was, however, refused by the surly monks,
with a look and grimace that said quite enough, as
they duly measured the ahmulah with a span, and
found that it was too short for their taste. Again
Walderheros was sent to the skin bag in which
was deposited the remainder of my last change for
a dollar. The cunning fellow, however, instead of
procuring another, as he told me afterwards, brought
back the same ahmulah again, and as the monks
did not think it decent to return it a second time,
they growled out the usual blessing of peace and
good fortune for me, with an imprecating curse for
the benefit of Walderheros, and then walked away.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>June 18th.</i>—I had now been three days in Aliu
Amba, and had begun to be familiar with the circumstances
around me, when the presence of several
of my Hy Soumaulee friends recalled the promise
I had made to them, and rendered it again
necessary to undertake the toilsome ascent to Ankobar.
My Dongola acquaintance, Hadjji Abdullah,
lent me his mule, and off I started, leaving the Hy
Soumaulee, who accompanied me across the market-place,
to amuse themselves how they could during
my absence. Walderheros walked by my side, and
by nine o’clock we arrived at the Residency where
a little flag, displayed, telegraphed the presence of
the Ambassador, Captain Harris, who had come
into town the night before from Angolahlah. I
was compelled to solicit, as a personal favour, that
which was denied as an act of justice; on the
strong representation that “these thirty dollars
would be the price of my blood,” our singularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
constituted Ambassador reluctantly consented to
advance me that sum from the treasury. Let it be
observed, that not one word of approbation was
bestowed upon the endeavours I had made to obtain
the restoration of the boxes, &amp;c., left by Messrs.
Bernatz and Scott at Hiero Murroo; and when I
alluded to that circumstance, the reply I received
was, “that any other party coming up would have
brought them on.” The irritation and excitement
consequent upon this interview aided the predisposition
to a relapse, and to that I principally attribute
the long illness which, from this date, afflicted me
for many months.</p>

<p>My request, however, in the end being acceded
to, after breakfast I prepared to return immediately
to Aliu Amba. Mr. Assistant-Surgeon Kirk
brought me a polite invitation from Captain Harris
to remain at least for the day. Being the anniversary
of Waterloo, some <em>appropriate</em> entertainment
was proposed, but as I received the message in no
very friendly spirit it was not repeated.</p>

<p>Of the thirty Hy Soumaulee engaged at Herhowlee,
only seventeen came to receive their additional
dollars, the remainder having left Channo with a
Kafilah that started before my first return to Aliu
Amba. The Ras had engaged them to accompany
him across the disturbed country between the
Hawash and Hiero Murroo, and after this party had
received the dollar and tobe from Ohmed Mahomed,
believing they should obtain no more, they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
taken the opportunity of returning home. The
remainder came in parties for the two or three
succeeding days, and went away satisfied with me,
but with some feeling of resentment against my
worthy Ras ul Kafilah, Ohmed Mahomed.</p>

<p>The first decided recurrence of a fit of the intermittent
fever, the paroxysms returning every other day,
from which I had suffered so much in Bombay and
Aden, came on during the afternoon of the day I
returned from Ankobar. My illness, however, did
not completely lay me up; for although on the day
when the ague fits occurred it was with the greatest
difficulty I could leave my bed, still, during the
intermediate ones I could always occupy myself in
obtaining information, either in the Amharic
language, or respecting the interesting circumstances
of novel character which surrounded me.</p>

<p>Many instructive conversations have I had with
the numerous retired slave merchants who reside in
Aliu Amba. The knowledge these men possessed
of the country to the south of Shoa, the kingdoms
of Gurague, of Enarea, of Zingero and of Limmoo,
with others still more remote, was extensive and
valuable, and was the result of actual visits to these
places for the purpose of procuring slaves. Successful
slave merchants have this character in
common with horse dealers, that they are generally
intelligent and shrewd men, and when they have
no object to serve by concealing the truth, they
may be relied upon to a considerable extent; for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
none know better the value of a straightforward
tale to secure confidence and good opinion. Profound
judges of human nature from their habits
and occupation, no one speaks truth like a clever
cheating slave-dealer when it will suit his purpose.
One of them in particular, however, I chose to be
my geographical instructor,—an old man named
Ibrahim, a native of the city of Hurrah, who
possessed every mental requisite to have been
recognised as a first rate traveller, had he only
possessed opportunities to record the observations
he had made upon men and countries that he had
visited.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Ibrahim had evidently amused himself during
his journeys into slave districts by examining the
characters of the very different people with whom
he came in contact, and the striking contrasts he
observed had led his attentive mind to the consideration
of the probable causes for the anomalies
he witnessed of the black Shankalli, the red
Amhara, and the yellow Gonga, all inhabiting a
plateau of limited extent. In the course of his long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
life having traversed in different directions the
whole of the table land from Enarea to Gondah, he
had been enabled by comparison and re-observation
to check and correct himself upon many points
which would otherwise have been very obscure.
It was not unusual for him to repeat to me instances
of such errors that he had at first fallen into, but
which he was subsequently enabled to correct by
other opportunities of observation. His ideas upon
ethnology were also exceedingly interesting and
curious, and I am convinced myself that many
conclusions he had arrived at on this subject are
correct, for by comparing my book-acquired information
with the remarkable knowledge he had collected
from facts, I could confirm many of the
singular truths that seemed to have enlightened his
mind, and which contributed greatly to my own
progress in that science.</p>

<p>My aged instructor would frequently draw upon
the earth floor of my residence a rude diagram of
the elevated plateau of Abyssinia, which was supposed
for our purposes to extend to the parallel of
Massoah in the north, and to that of Zanzibar
in the south. East and west its extent was
represented to be about half this distance. In a
large depression in the eastern border, the sources
of the river Hawash were represented to be, and
opposite, upon the west, was a similar indentation,
where the waters of the various rivers that
drain this table land fall from above to join
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
the Nile below. Abyssinia, in fact, stands prominently
upon the low land around it, like an island
in a dried-up sea, and it is this which has given
occasion for the Abyssinians to compare their
country with the orange red flower of the Soof,
(<i lang="la">Carthamus tinctorius</i>,)<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the compound corolla
surrounded by sharp thorns, which are supposed
aptly enough to represent the barbarous Galla
tribes that beset Abyssinia on every side.</p>

<p>In this delineation of Abyssinia by Ibrahim I
first observed the discrepancy between the present
received opinions of our geographers, that that
country is connected on the south with a supposed
extensive table land in the interior of Africa, and
that which is entertained by the natives themselves,
of the well defined and distinctly marked isolated
plateau they inhabit.</p>

<p>Upon the represented surface of Abyssinia two
principal streams were now delineated, one called
the Abiah, flowing from the east and the south;
and the other from the north, the Abi, or Bruce’s
Nile, which falls into the Abiah immediately after
leaving the table land in the vicinity of Fazuglo.
From the rivers Abi and Abiah is derived the name
Abisha, the original of our word Abyssinia, signifying
the country of the Abi; “cha” or “sha,”
country, being a frequent compound of the names
of large localities, as Dembeacha, the country of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Dembea; Angotcha, the country of Angot;
Damotcha, and many others.</p>

<p>We now came to the more interesting examination
of the sources and course of the river Gibbee, the
great geographical problem connected with this
country as yet undecided by any competent
authority. There is no doubt, however, that the
Gibbee of the present day is the Zibbee of the
Portuguese travellers of the seventeenth century,
and the Kibbee of Bruce. Recent visitors to
these countries, Krapf, Beke, and Harris, all bear
testimony to the correctness of the account given by
their predecessors, that this river runs to the south
and empties itself into the Indian Ocean. I have
ventured to differ altogether from these travellers;
and, as will be perceived in my diagram map at the
commencement of this volume, I direct the stream
of the Zibbee or Gibbee to the north and west,
contributing to form the much larger river Abiah,
which is the main branch of Assa-abi, or red
river, most erroneously written in all European
maps Bahr ul Assareek, or the Blue Nile. It
is impossible to say with whom this error
originated, but probably with some speculative
geographer; for by distorting the words “assa
arogue” in Amharic, the old red river, a word,
similar in sound to a Turkish one, signifying blue,
has been manufactured; and Assareek, or Blue
Nile, is now the generally received name of the
time-honoured Assa-abinus, the Jupiter of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
ancient Ethiopians, and the original, I believe, of
the Egyptian god Serapis. The true blue river is,
in fact, the Nile itself, “nil” being the name of
indigo at the present day all along the valley of
that river; and in the same language, let it be
borne in mind, as every other important designation
of this interesting part of the world, the word
“nil” is still the word for blue, and with such a
signification we find it in many names of places
both in India and Persia, of which a familiar
example is the celebrated Sanatarium station, near
Madras, of Neilgherry, from <i lang="la">Nila gira</i>, the blue
hills. The sacred colour, also, that which distinguished
the priests of ancient Egypt, was blue, and
no doubt bore some reference to the name of the
river, which was originally the object of their
worship, for in the names of two of its principal
branches, Apis and Serapis, we have the elements
of the words Abi and Assaabi, the terminal sigma
being the usual Grecian affix to foreign names.</p>

<p>In this manner I bring in the authority of
Herodotus, and of the Egyptian priest who informed
him of the origin of the Nile, in support of my
views respecting the rivers of Abyssinia.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
generally admitted that the Bahr ul Abiad was
scarcely known to the ancients; at all events it
held but a very inferior rank in any account of
the rivers of Africa that has been transmitted to
our times. I am, therefore, led to believe that
the scribe of the sacred treasury of Minerva, who
willingly informed Herodotus of what he knew
respecting the sources of the Nile, alluded to the
two streams of the table land of Abyssinia, the
Abi flowing from the north, and the Abiah flowing
from the south; which rivers uniting formed
the Assa-abi of ancient days, the Assa-arogue of
modern times, and which most certainly was the
object of religious worship among the ancient
Ethiopians.</p>

<p>I would not dare to advance an opinion so directly
opposed to the apparently well-considered conclusions
arrived at by previous travellers, but that I
am convinced that those which they now advocate
have been the result of biassed consultations in the
closet, where ingenious, but not travelled, geographers
have successfully combated the actual
results of information derived upon the spot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
Krapf, Beke, and Harris, all sent home maps and
information, in which the river Gibbee is made
to join the Nile, and each have successively given
way to subsequent influences. The fact of the
Assa-abi, or Assareek, flooding in May, according to
the observation of Mr. Inglish, who accompanied
the expedition of Mahomed Allee to Sennaar, could
not be accounted for by Abyssinian travellers
without, in fact, leading the Gibbee, or some other
large river, to join the Abi, or Bruce’s Nile, for
this latter does not commence to swell before the
latter end of June, and could not therefore contribute
to the rise of the waters of the Assa-abi in
May. This was another reason that should have
influenced these travellers to adhere to their
Abyssinian information, for no argument that could
be brought to bear against it could stand for a
moment. But, it has been observed, there is
the positive testimony of the Father Antonio Fernandez,
who, in 1615, passed over the Kibbee
twice in his journey to Enarea and Zingero. To
this I answer, that the historiographer of “The
Travels of Jesuits in Abyssinia,” F. Balthazer Tellez,
so represents it, but not, I think, upon the authority
of Fernandez, but merely as an opinion of his own;
but asserted with so much positiveness, that it
might readily be supposed part of the information
which he derived from Fernandez. Compare what
Tellez says in his summary of the rivers of Ethiopia—“There
is another celebrated river called Zebee, <em>said</em>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
<em>to be greater than the Nile itself</em>, rising in a territory
called Bora, in the kingdom of Narea, which is the
most southerly, and whereof we shall speak hereafter.
It begins its course westward, a few leagues
farther turns to the northward, and runs about the
kingdom of Zingero, of which we shall also give
an account, making it a sort of peninsula, as the
Nile does the kingdom of Gojam. After leaving
this kingdom, it takes its course to the southward;
and some say, it is the same that falls into the sea
at Mombaza.” Tellez alludes to the course of the
Zebee again, when recounting the visit of Fernandez
to the Court of Zingero; but merely
observes, that it encompasses the kingdom of
Zingero, making it a sort of peninsula, and then
runs to empty itself towards the coast of Melinda;
thus embodying, as it were, in an account of the
southern parts of Abyssinia, professed to be given by
Fernandez, that view of the course of the river he had
previously advocated and represented in the small
map placed at the commencement of his volume.</p>

<p>Tellez, whilst he is minute enough upon the
manners and customs of the people of Abyssinia,
and dilates upon the history of the labours of his
order in that country, contrives to mystify us
considerably in the geography and politics. I
cannot help thinking he was directed by some
Government to write as he did for a particular
purpose, or was jealous of other nations reaping the
benefits of the ill-judged policy of the Jesuits,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
which had terminated in their exclusion from the
country; and, which, he was fully conscious, was
a very available and a wide field for religious zeal
or commercial enterprise to reap rich rewards for
the trouble of exploring.</p>

<p>It is a matter of the greatest notoriety, that even
in the present enlightened times, it does not
follow, because the emissaries of any Government
visit and observe unknown countries, that they give
correct geographical or political information for the
benefit of other nations. Least of any, can such
disingenuousness be expected from the Portuguese
Court of the seventeenth century; and I cannot
therefore, but believe, confirmed as the opinion is
by the internal evidence of the book itself, that the
imperfect, incorrect, and distorted account of the
travels of the Jesuits in Ethiopia, was written for
the political purpose of misleading the enterprising
spirits of other nations. Most effectually did it
accomplish this object, and for two more centuries
was this important country consigned to that
obscurity, in which, for so many ages previous to
its re-discovery by the Portuguese, its history had
been involved. This, however, was not the only
injury done to the progress of human civilization;
for whilst the natives were thus allowed to fall still
lower in barbarism, the Jesuitical statements
interfered with European enlightenment; and
geographers and men of letters have been misled in
many particulars respecting the character of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
country, and of the disposition of the various
people who inhabit Abyssinia. I can ill afford the
space, but to illustrate the manner in which
Tellez endeavours to mislead, as regards geographical
matters, I will here introduce a most glaring
instance, which, I trust, may be received as my
apology and excuse for presuming, as I have done,
to question the integrity of the great authority of
recent Abyssinian travellers; for, without Tellez,
they have no authenticated evidence to oppose
against that, which I can bring forward to prove
that the Gibbee flows, not to the south, and to the
Indian ocean, but to the north, and into the Nile.
Even Bruce, much as I respect him, as the prince of
travellers, evidently follows Tellez in his account of
the Gibbee; and it is curious to remark, that not
only as regards this river, but upon other subjects
where he has exaggerated so much as to be supposed
to be drawing upon his imagination, he is
actually using almost the very words of the Jesuit
historian.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Embassy dispatched to Portugal
in the year 1613, by the Emperor Segued, which
consisted of some natives of rank, accompanied by
the father Antonio Fernandez, and ten other Portuguese,
Tellez informs us, “These men were
directed to take a route through Narea to Melinda,
upon the coast, the Emperor believing (and he, it
may be supposed, would be very likely to have the
best information) that the road was shorter and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
easier than the one to Massoah.” This opinion
we find still farther confirmed when the Embassy
arrived at Narea, for there the Bonero, or Governor,
determined the party should not proceed “by the
way they designed, which was the best, lest the
Portuguese should become acquainted with it.”
These native authorities, however, are deemed of
no value by Tellez, who thus decides the matter at
once, “Now, to deal plainly, the way the father
(Fernandez) proposed through Cafah was no better
than this (the road back again to the north and
east); because, proceeding south from Narea, there
is no coming to the sea without travelling many
hundred leagues to the Cape of Good Hope, as
may appear by all modern maps, so that the whole
project had nothing of likelihood.”</p>

<p>Father Antonio Fernandez himself does not
appear, in Tellez, to have kept any regular account
of the journey; and yet there is internal evidence
in what is given to the reader in the “Travels of
the Jesuits,” that in reality the greatest attention
was paid to every subject of interest; and as we
must conceive that the first object of the Government,
who supported and encouraged the Jesuits
in Abyssinia, was to obtain correct geographical
knowledge of that part of Africa, I cannot but
believe that this was particularly attended to by
their agents; but that when afterwards the travels
were published to satisfy public curiosity, it
was found convenient to suppress the most important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
information. This reason is sufficient also
to account for the mysterious disappearance of the
greater part of the documents which assisted Tellez
in drawing up his compilation, a suspicious circumstance
of itself, that the object of this book was
anything but to give a correct description of the
physical character and capabilities of the country
of Abyssinia.</p>

<p>I have dwelt too long, perhaps, upon an unimportant
subject, but it is necessary, because modern
geographers invariably advance Tellez as an
unquestionable authority upon the subject of the
water-shed of the Gibbee; and with his assistance
they have already obliged more than one Abyssinian
traveller to throw aside information received
in the country, and instead of adhering to
opinions advocated whilst there, to repudiate the
whole, and follow in supporting errors they thus
confessed themselves unable to refute. This is not
the only evil of their inconsistency, for their
present opinions are so many important authorities
which have an equal claim to the attention of the
scientific world as my own, and render it impossible
for my testimony, even were it demonstrated to be
correct, to be received against the conjoined evidence
of two or three others who have visited Abyssinia
as well as myself. This I admit to be fair, but not
so the attempts which have been made to convince
me of my geographical errors, not by argument, but
by threats of all kinds of critical pains and penalties,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
for my presumption in advancing views so contrary
to generally received accounts. Be it so, I feel
quite assured there is some portion of the reviewing
press, who will scorn to be made the instruments
of unfair attacks upon any one, contending only for
what he believes to be true, and for no other
motive, but the instruction of himself and others.</p>

<p>Around his rude outline of Abyssinia, my native
informant Ibrahim placed representatives of the
Shankalli, who surrounded that country, except
upon its eastern side, where another black race, the
Dankalli, testify by their skins, to a similar low
elevation of the country they inhabit. Ibrahim
thus undesignedly proved the correctness of his
information, for it struck me, that no physical
feature is so conclusive as to the character of a
country, whether high or low land, than the complexion
of its inhabitants. An exception, however,
to thus entirely surrounding the high land of
Abyssinia with the two nations of blacks was
made to the north and south of the country of
Adal, where two oppositely situated water-sheds are
drained by the two rivers, the Tacazza and the
Whabbee, the former flowing into the Nile, the
latter into the Indian Ocean at Jubah. The
character of both the countries through which
these rivers flow are, in one respect, similar; their
elevation being intermediate between the low plains
of Adal, and the table land of Abyssinia, or about six
thousand feet high above the level of the sea. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
inhabitants of either water-shed also resemble each
other in their colour, being a dark brown, modified
by parentage and descent, for the complexion of the
inhabitants of Tigre and Angotcha, approaches to
the red colour of the real Abyssinian, whilst the
skins of the Gallas around the sources of the Whabbee
have a duskier inclination towards the original
colour of their Dankalli and Shankalli parents.</p>

<p>To the north of Dembeacha, around the lower
course of the Tacazza, European travellers attest
the existence of Shankalli, whilst the officers
attached to the exploring armies of Mahomed Allee,
found them also all along the course of Bahr ul
Assareek to Fazuglo, and report them as extending
an indefinite distance to the south. On the
other hand, I have seen and spoken with Shankalli
or negroes who had been brought into Shoa
from beyond Kuffah, Enarea, and Limmoo; and
Ibrahim also was most particular in stating that all
around those places to the south was the black
country, <i>Tokruah</i>, the Amharic name for that colour,
and which is the origin of the general native designation
of interior Africa, and is synonymous with
<i>Sudan</i>, derived from the Arabic <i>Asward</i>, black.</p>

<p>The inference that is to be derived from this fact,
of the Shankalli being found in the immediate
neighbourhood of a very light complexioned people,
is, that the high table land of Abyssinia suddenly
slopes, on its south and west sides, from the elevation
of ten or twelve thousand feet, to a low
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
country of less than three thousand feet high, a
scarp of perhaps thirty miles only intervening
between the two very differently situated countries.</p>

<p>I take it for granted the reader is aware that the
light yellow-coloured people of Enarea and Zingero
attest, by their skin, the elevation I have assumed
for these southern Abyssinian kingdoms. It is,
I think, undeniable that the table-land increases
in elevation to the south, for all travellers agree
that the complexion of the inhabitants becomes
fairer as they increase in distance from Shoa in
that direction; and I need not observe the contrary
would naturally be expected as we approach
nearer to the equator. Several people I have seen,
however, who came from within five degrees of the
line, and were much lighter coloured than the
generality of Spaniards. This would not be the
case with a people living only upon a mountain
ridge, even if the delicate frames of the yellow
Zingero people attested, by a different character,
the hardy life of a mountaineer. There must be,
therefore, I should suppose, a considerable continuity
of surface to seclude a large family of
man from the otherwise unavoidable intercourse
with the darker skinned inhabitants of the low
land, and to have enabled a very ancient people
to continue unchanged their fair complexion nearly
in the centre of a continent of blacks.</p>

<p>These are the principal reasons which have led me
to contend for the tabular character of Abyssinia to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the south, instead of, as modern travellers invariably
represent it, as being divided through its extent
by an anticlinal axis, which divides the waters that
flow to the north-west and to the Nile, from those
which, on the contrary, proceed to the south-east
and to the Indian Ocean. This impression, and
Tellez’s apparently positive statement that the
Zibbee flows to the southward, I am afraid, however
will still be proof against my arguments, and
until some enterprizing traveller visits the countries
of Enarea and Zingero, and decides by actual
observation, my readers may still amuse themselves
by forming opinions upon this debatable
subject. For their assistance I have, therefore,
recorded the results of my observations, and the
information I received in a country scarcely one
hundred miles from these interesting and remote
localities.</p>

<p>The Gibbee, or Zibbee, by Ibrahim’s account, rose
in Enarea, where its sources were called <i>Somma</i>,
which, in the Gonga language signifies, “head.”
At this place, annually, many superstitious practices
are observed, the last remains, I expect, of the
ancient river worship that was once general
throughout the whole of Abyssinia. The Agows of
Northern Abyssinia, who are of Gonga origin, still
profess to worship the Abi, although no traveller
has yet given us any account of their ceremonies;
the more to be regretted, as it would throw considerable
light upon the ancient customs of an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
early state of society, when Abyssinia was the
centre of all civilization in the world.</p>

<p>After flowing some distance to the south and
east, the Gibbee was represented to me as taking
a course similar to that of the Abi around Gojam,
nearly encircling the kingdom of Zingero, which is
separated from Gurague by this very stream, then a
large river, and still flowing to the south. After
passing westward between Zingero and Kuffah, the
Gibbee then takes the name of Ankor from the
principal province of Zingero which borders upon
it, and in which the King resides; it then bends
towards the north and west, passing to the south
of Enarea, where it is called Durr, and receives a
large river, the Omo, coming from Kuffah. From
several reasons I believe the Omo to be the main
branch, and the Durr merely another name for it;
however, as some large stream does join the Gibbee
from the south, I have so designated in my map
one which I have laid down as coming from that
direction. After the Gibbee has passed Enarea, it
flows to the west of Limmoo, where it is best known
as the Abiah, the common Galla name of the large
river which, in that situation, breaks from the table-land,
and then proceeds towards the north some
distance through the country of the Shankalli
before it receives, in the neighbourhood of Fazuglo,
the waters of the Abi, which drains northern Abyssinia.
After the junction of these two, the name
Gibbee then re-assumes in part its most ancient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
name Assa-arogue, the original of Assareek, meaning
in Amharic the old Assa, or red river, so called
from flowing through the country of the red people,
in contradistinction to that portion of the Nile
supposed to flow from a country of the whites:
hence, the name of Ab-Addo, the principal western
branch of the Bahr ul Abiad, which, as in Arabic,
signifies “the river of the whites.”</p>

<p>Gibbee, the modern form of Zibbee, lends its
name to assist in unravelling the mystery of its
course, for I derive it from the word Azzabe, or
Assabi; the origin of the Assabinus, whom Latin
authors represent to have been the Jupiter of the
Ethiopians, by which is meant, I presume, the
principal god of the people. If it be admitted that
its name and that of the Zibbee are the same, there
can be but little doubt of their streams being one,
and that the latter is the early course of the former.
Strange rumours reach the ears of travellers in
Abyssinia, of human sacrifices being still practised
by the Pagan inhabitants of Zingero, whilst even
in the Christian kingdom of Enarea it is not
unusual for slave Kafilahs, on crossing the Gibbee,
to propitiate the god of that river by immolating
the most beautiful of the virgin slaves in its waters.
A similar custom was formerly practised in Egypt;
for an Arab geographer, quoted by Mr. Cooley,
either in his Notes to “Larcher’s Herodotus,” or
“The Negroland of the Arabs,” records this circumstance.
This coincidence of an inhuman practice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
seems also to point to a connexion between the
sacred character of the Gibbee and that of the Nile.
Another ceremony also, in which, on the election of a
king, the inhabitants of Zingero collect upon the
banks of the Gibbee, until upon some one’s head
a bee should rest, who is immediately proclaimed to
be the sovereign, I have some idea was the reason
of that little insect being made the hieroglyphical
representative of king or chief among the ancient
Egyptians, and perhaps at one period of their
history a similar custom prevailed among them.</p>

<p>The Gibbee is at the present time a holy river, as
was the Assabi among the Ethiopians, and which
was also the original of the Egyptian god, Serapis.
This latter supposition is confirmed by the fact that,
in some parts of its course, the Abi of Northern
Abyssinia at the present day is similarly worshipped,
and that its sources, in the time of the Portuguese
missionaries, were actually the scene of Pagan sacrifices.
The ancient Apis I consider to have been no
other; for the Grecian terminal being rejected, the
identity of the two names Abi and Api is manifest,
whilst that of Assabi and Serapi is equally evident.</p>

<p>That the river Gibbee cannot be the earlier tributary
of the Gochob of Dr. Beke, is proved by
what we are told by Major Harris, of a river so
called, entering the sea at Jubah. If this be the
case there can no longer be any doubt of the identity
of the Gochob with the Whabbee, and which I
feel more assured of, from the information I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
received, compared with the accounts sent to the
Geographical Society of Paris, by M. d’Abbadie,
from Berberah, on the Soumaulee coast, respecting
the entrance of the Whabbee into the sea at Jubah.</p>

<p>Nor is this idea at all affected by the discoveries of
Lieut. Christopher on the coast near Brava, respecting
a river said to be the Whabbee, which runs
parallel to the sea-coast in that situation for more
than one hundred miles, and then terminates in a
fresh-water lake, some short distance inland; for
this may be the northern arm of a delta-formed
termination of the river, which has been prevented
from reaching the sea in that situation, by the
strong marine current known to exist along that
coast, to the south-west. This has occasioned the
silting up of this entrance of the river, so that it is
only in very high seasons indeed of flood, that the
fluvatile water bursts through, or overflows the
barrier, and escapes to the sea. The mouths of
several other African rivers present similar phenomena.
The discovery of the Haines branch of the
delta of the Whabbee proves, in fact, the correctness
of all native accounts, who represent a large
branch as leaving the main trunk of the Whabbee
at Ganana, and terminating in a lake of fresh
water, not far distant from Brava, and which intercepted
river is supposed to resemble “<i>a tail</i>,” and
hence the name, “Ganana.” All informants agree,
however, that the principal stream, still called the
Whabbee, proceeds to Jubah, so that unless the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
Gochob is admitted to be that river, some other
<i lang="fr">embouchure</i> must be procured for the latter.</p>

<p>Denying, in this manner, the connexion of the
Gibbee with the Gochob of Dr. Beke, for every
Abyssinian informant states positively that the
Gibbee does not go to the Whabbee, and which, as
far as I can judge, appears to be the original of the
Gochob, there is but one other river flowing to the
south, which the Gibbee can be supposed to join.
This is the Kalli, which empties itself into the
Indian Ocean by many mouths, about three degrees
south of the equator, the principal of which
appears to be that of Lamoo. No traveller gives
any account of this river, though certainly it is a
most important one in connexion with our future
intercourse with the high land of Abyssinia. It is,
as its name, Kalli, implies, a river of the black
people, as the Assabi, or Zebee, of the table land
above belongs exclusively to the country of a red
race. The Portuguese name, Killimancy, is merely
the addition of a word, signifying river in the
Shankalli language, to the original Arian term,
Kalli. The sources of this river are upon the
southern scarp of the Abyssinian table land, in the
same manner as the tributaries of the Hawash arise
upon the eastern border. The two principal
branches of the Kalli, I was told, enclose or receive
in the bifurcation, the termination of the table land
to the south.</p>

<p>A considerable degree of interest attaches itself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
to this river, and I could wish to see the attention
of our geographers and politicians directed to its
examination. All the red Abyssinian slaves, after
a month’s journey through the country about the
upper part of its course, are then embarked and
conveyed down this river to Lamoo, to be carried
away and disposed of in the Asiatic markets. It
is by this channel also the Abashee colonies on the
Malabar coast, of which Major Jervis has written
some notices in a late volume of the “Bombay
Geographical Society’s Journal,” are recruited.
Those of the native Christians on the same coast I
have seen myself are decidedly of Abyssinian origin,
and perhaps that religion may have been introduced
into India by missionaries from that country. It
was singular that when an important and expensive
Political Mission was about being sent into Abyssinia,
some inquiries were not made respecting
this southern route, along which a considerable
intercourse at the present day exists between India
and Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Independently of the table land to the south of
the Gibbee increasing considerably in elevation,
every other circumstance connected with its name
and situation tends to show that the direction of
its stream cannot be towards the south to join the
Kalli. The stream of the Gibbee, in fact, is a
large and navigable river, crossed immediately by
slave Kafilahs from Enarea and Zingero during their
journey to Lamoo, and they have then to proceed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
an entire month before they come to another river,
the Kalli, to convey them to their destination.
The Whabbee and the Kalli, therefore, can neither
of them be supposed to be the lower stream of the
Gibbee; but there is a large river of which every Galla
speaks who comes from Limmoo, Jimma, and other
districts in that neighbourhood; and which flows
south, say Mr. M’Queen and Major Harris, whilst
Dr. Beke denied its existence altogether, until my
views were laid before the Geographical Society.
He admitted certainly having heard, the small stream
of the Dedassa, flowing into the Abi, in one
instance called the Abiah. This gentleman appears
to have confounded the names Abi and Abiah,
believing that the latter was the Galla pronunciation
of the former, and his Geography of Southern
Abyssinia being founded upon this supposition,
he fell into the opposite error to Major Harris; and
crowded into a position too close upon the south of
the Abi, countries which, upon the authority of the
latter, have been carried to a situation not far from
the equator; and the Abiah, contrary to any sound
information that could possibly have been received,
is taken away, to flow through unknown lands to
the south and west, where it is made to join the
<i>Bahr ul Abiad</i>. Such are travellers’ reports, and I
profess to give no better, only that I cannot afford
to sacrifice the information I have obtained upon
this subject, to the speculative ideas of geographers,
however learned, and therefore obstinately persist in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
what they consider to be error, when it has more
the appearance of truth, than have the theories
which they can only advance in opposition.</p>

<p>The Abiah, which is almost denied to exist by
one traveller, and taken into remote countries by
another, I believe to be the main branch of the
Gibbee, and have accordingly so laid it down in
the sketch map of the different water-sheds of
Abyssinia I have projected to assist me in explaining
my ideas upon the subject.</p>

<p>I will not, as I am almost tempted, recapitulate
the evidences that the Gibbee, the Abiah, and
the ancient Assabi, are one and the same river, and
the principal branch of the Abyssinian Nile; for
if that which I have said is not sufficient to
convince; to continue would only be to fatigue the
reader with suppositions, probabilities, and beliefs,
that would still, in the end, leave the subject in
quite as unsatisfactory a state as it remains at
present.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> This individual figures in Major Harris’s “Highland of
Ethiopia” as Hadjji Mahomed; and the whole occurrence there
related happened during the journey to the coast in 1843. It is
difficult, therefore, to understand how it could be recorded as an
incident of a journey in 1841, and in an account stated to have been
written in the heart of Abyssinia. Numerous other instances of
this kind of interpolation of adventure could be pointed out which
would be immaterial, only, as I shall probably allude to the same
circumstances myself, of course I am anxious not to be supposed

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> illness increasing, each succeeding paroxysm
of fever leaving me in a more weakened condition,
my servant proposed a remedy, boasted never to fail
in effecting a cure. I had but a scanty stock of
medicines, that I had brought with me from Aden,
and these seemed to have little or no effect upon
my disease; so I determined to give Walderheros a
chance of distinguishing himself by conferring
health upon his “gaitah” (master).</p>

<p>To do this properly, it was deemed necessary
that some water should be fetched from a spring
by a man, and as this is a species of labour always
performed by women, Walderheros, not to be seen
at such employment, undertook to take the water-jar
for that purpose the next morning before daylight.
I also learnt that the cure was to be effected by a kind
of shower-bath, to which I was to submit, sitting
down whilst the water was poured from a height
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
upon my head, during the attack of the rigors
which preceded the hot stage of the ague fit.</p>

<p>The next day, accordingly, the water having been
properly procured, on the first symptoms of the fit
coming on, I sat down in the shade of a large
ankor tree, a variety of the myrrh, that grows at
an elevation of seven thousand feet above the sea, but
yields no gum. Here, wrapt up in an Abyssinian
tobe, which upon the first fall of the water I was
to drop from my shoulders, I awaited the coming
shower from above, for Walderheros had climbed
into the tree, whilst some assistants lifted up to
him the large jar which contained the water. The
remedy, however, when it did come down, immediately
laid me full length upon the earth, for what
with the collapse of the system attendant upon the
cold stage and the cold falling water, it certainly
cut short the fever, but nearly at the expense of
my life, for even when I recovered from the first
shock, and was taken back to my bed, I was
delirious for several hours after,—a circumstance that
I have often had reason to be thankful for, had not
been a very usual symptom of my disease.</p>

<p>After this experience, that white men required a
very different medical treatment to the red Abyssinians
(for in this manner Walderheros endeavoured
to account for the failure of his hydropathic
remedy), I was not asked again to submit to any
more native means of cure for some time; as my
recovery, however, was of the greatest importance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
to me, I commenced a regular course of quinine
and James’s Powder, and had it not been for a
most disagreeable interruption in the quiet and
retired life I was leading in Aliu Amba, I might,
perhaps, have been soon restored to health.</p>

<p>On the tenth day after my last visit to Ankobar,
the Negoos and the members of the Embassy
having, in the meantime, left that city for Angolahlah,
a message was brought to Miriam’s house
for me to go immediately to the Governor of the
town, who had just arrived from the Court on
purpose to have me brought before him.</p>

<p>Feeling a little better than I had been for some
time, and being curious to know what business the
Governor could have with me, I followed his messenger,
taking with me, as a present on being
introduced, an old pocket telescope. It was fortunate
that I recollected to do this, for on my
giving it to him he was so highly pleased, that he
told me, through an Islam Hadjji named Abdullah,
that he was willing to serve me in any way he
could in the very awkward position I now learned
I was placed in, by the order he had received from
the Negoos. For some reason or other, my presence
in the kingdom had raised a jealous feeling somewhere,
and, in consequence, a most arbitrary
mandate, considering the then relations between
Shoa and England, was issued, and I was directed
to leave the country the very next day. Whilst
we were speaking, two men were sent with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Walderheros for my boxes, to be brought at once
to the Governor’s house, previous to their being
forwarded to Farree, where the Kafilah with which
I had come up, and which was now on the eve of
starting, afforded the opportunity of my proceeding
to the sea-coast. Here was another practical proof
of the value of the commercial treaty, and bitterly
I commented, as may be supposed, upon the worthless
parchment. I felt quite assured that it would
be of no use applying to our Ambassador for redress,
so considered it would be best to submit in peace,
and made no objections, therefore, to my boxes
being taken to the Governor’s house.</p>

<p>Not having made up my mind though, for all
that, to leave the country, I determined, after I had
left Tinta (the name of the Governor) to go and
consult with a sincere friend of mine, an Edjow
Galla named Sheik Tigh, who had shown himself
possessed of the kindest disposition by his disinterested
and patient attendance upon my sick bed
during the short period I had resided in Aliu
Amba. He was a Mahomedan mollum, or scribe,
for his occupation was writing copies of the Koran,
which he used to sell to the slave merchants who
came from the more barbarous countries around
Shoa. Either on account of the trifling sum that
these manuscript Korans can be purchased for in
Abyssinia, or the excessive neatness with which
Amhara Mahomedans write Arabic compared with
even Arabs themselves, these Abyssinian copies are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
highly prized even along the sacred or eastern
coast of the Red Sea, and in Jeddah will command
an increased value of two hundred per cent. upon
their original cost.</p>

<p>Sheik Tigh concurred immediately in my proposed
plan, either of endeavouring to remain in
Shoa by a personal request to be made to the
Negoos; or of going away to Giddem, and from
there to the court of Beroo Lobo, the Mahomedan
chief of that portion of the Argobbah, or valley
country that extends to the north of Efat, as far as
the river Tahlahlac, one of the most northern tributaries
of the Hawash. The state of my finances,
however, I found would not admit of this latter
alternative; for, excepting the thirteen dollars
remaining of the Hy Soumaulee money, I had only
seven dollars in the world.</p>

<p>It was at length determined amongst us, for
Hadjji Abdullah had joined in our consultation, that
I should take another present to Tinta, as a kind of
bribe, and the real object of which Sheik Tigh was
to explain to him. I accordingly packed up a
damask table-cloth, and provided myself with three
of the most favoured dollars I was possessed of, and
thus armed, went again in the dusk of the evening
to the house of the Governor. My offering was very
quietly received and concealed, by which I perceived
the business had been properly managed by
Sheik Tigh, and that it was understood I was to
have unmolested, three hours’ start of him the next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
morning, to get over the most difficult portion of
the road to Angolahlah before he followed in
pursuit; a little manœuvre necessary to keep up
appearances with the Negoos; for although it
would have been no very heinous offence to have
permitted me the opportunity of appealing to the
justice of Sahale Selassee, Tinta might have suffered
for his generosity in permitting me to come to
Angolahlah, when he had received orders to accompany
me to Farree. Tinta, like most Abyssinians,
was a really kind-hearted man, but his education
as a courtier, and that in a despotic court, had
taught him dissimulation and caution.</p>

<p>Walderheros, it may be supposed, was violently
affected at the prospect of losing his father, mother,
brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins, all
being, according to his account, rolled up in me.
He often used to observe, he was my child; though
he was (beautiful boy) at least ten years older
than myself. He now protested he should never
survive our cruel separation. If it had not been
for that “kaffu” (wicked) Hawash, those “kaffu
Adaloitsh,” (wicked Dankalli,) and that “kaffu
bahr,” (wicked sea,) he swore that he would have
followed me over the rest of the world. In this
manner he went on talking during the whole of the
evening, with many imprecatory bursts of “woi
Negoos,” and “min Abat,” at the same time
busying himself making preparations for our sanctioned
escape next morning to Angolahlah, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
what with cooking and expostulating with some
imaginary evil destiny that pursued him, he kept
me awake nearly the whole night.</p>

<p>As Hadjji Abdullah, after it was dark, had
brought me his own mule, it was stabled for the
night in my house, and long before cock-crow the
next morning we were carefully descending in the
dark the step-like road of rough stones which leads
from the top of Aliu Amba into the direct road to
Ankobar. We were obliged to be very cautious in
our progress along the steep slippery bank, and the
edges of deep muddy pools produced by the first
showers of the rainy season, which had fallen the
few days previously, and had not at all improved
the condition of the road.</p>

<p>The sun had risen before we reached Ankobar.
On this occasion it was unnecessary to go through
that town; so having surmounted the long ridge in
front, instead of continuing along it, we crossed
directly over, leaving the little wooden cross and
church of Goodis Gorgis (St. George) in its encircling
grove of quolqual and wild fig-trees, on our
left hand. The road we followed was exceedingly
narrow, and fell very gradually in a prolonged
sweep down the steep descent into the valley of the
Airahra. Half way down is a broad terrace of considerable
extent covered with immense boulders
from the destruction of the ridge above, and which
appears to be more rapidly denuded upon this face
than upon the opposite one looking towards Aliu
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Amba. On a mound of the detached rocks and
soil in this situation is built a church, dedicated to
“Abbo,” the father, the only one I have ever seen
so situated except the meeting-houses of the Tabibe
sect, who do not pay that respect to ancient superstitions
that still influences the other Christians of
Abyssinia. A sufficient reason, however, accounts
for its low elevation.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the reign of the
present Negoos, a great portion of the ancient
grove of Abbo and its church still occupied the
highest point of the ridge over which we had just
come. The denuding operations of the conjointed
actions of earthquakes and rainy seasons overcame
every endeavour that was made to protect the
sacred spot from being encroached upon, it having
been one of the most ancient and most revered of
the sacred edifices in Shoa. Annually large
portions were precipitated into the valley of the
Airahra; and ultimately the last portion of the walls
of the church disappeared, after a violent convulsion
of the earth, and a single line of trees, the
remains of a once extensive grove, now marks its
former site. The spot is still considered sacred,
and so attached were the monks upon the establishment,
to the ancient edifice, that, observing that the
greater portion of the debris had fallen upon the
terrace beneath, they determined to erect upon it a
representative of the old church, although on so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
low an elevation compared with the numerous
heights around.</p>

<p>This is, however, the only instance I know of
a church of the Abyssinian Christians being so
situated, for it is a particular feature of the worship
in this country that all religious buildings should
surmount “some earth o’ertopping mountain;” and
to such an extent is this feeling carried, that sacred
hills which have become lowered in consequence of
the greater denudation of their summits, is a reason
sometimes for changing the site of the church to
some neighbouring hill that, from more favourable
causes, has preserved its height undiminished.
A striking instance of this change, and its assigned
cause, is found in the circumstances connected with
the erection of the new church of St. Michael,
which stands upon a hill to the east of the Negoos’s
residence, in the valley of the “Michael wans.”
Here two groves are observed standing on hills
near to each other, the more modern one being of
much greater elevation than the other. Both are
dedicated to the same saint, and on asking Walderheros
why there should be two, he pointed out the
difference in the height of the hills upon which
they stood as a reason why the lower should be
deserted, and preference given to the higher hill
for the site of the “bate y Christian,” and the
residence of the monks.</p>

<p>Looking upon these groves surrounding temples of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
religion, and serving as retreats for officiating priests,
each of whom has his little cottage among the trees,
it is impossible to help reflecting upon the changes
in man’s history, recalled by observing such existing
monuments of former feelings and religious prejudices.
The question naturally suggested itself,
what could have been the popular belief when the
more ancient of the St. Michael’s groves was first
planted; for a long period must have elapsed to
have occasioned, by the disintegrating action of its
vegetation, so much denudation of the hill it crowns,
as to make it more than one hundred feet lower
than the present frequented one; and originally it
must have been the highest in the neighbourhood.
I have observed other customs existing in Abyssinia
that strongly reminded me of Druidism and of
similar characteristic observances among the ancient
Persians; and I certainly looked with some degree
of interest upon a grove, that might once have
been the scene of the celebration of religious
ceremonies, of a very different character to those
which distinguish the modern faith.</p>

<p>Although it was so early when we reached the
church of Abbo, Walderheros proposed breakfasting.
I accordingly dismounted, and after a gaze
upwards at the largest tree I had seen since I left
England, took my seat beneath its widely-extended
branches, upon one of a number of small boulders
which had rolled from the rocks above. A
quantity of long strips of grilled mutton, was produced,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
and some teff bread, a large manuscript-like
roll of which Walderheros carried tied
up in his mekanet or girdle. This useful part of
an Abyssinian dress is only worn by the men when
engaged out of doors. It is one long piece of
cotton cloth, about one cubit, or from the point of
the elbow to the ends of the fingers, broad, and
fifteen, twenty, or sometimes even thirty cubits long.
A girdle similar to this was worn by the Jews.
Sometimes in Abyssinia it is taken from the loins
of a prisoner to secure his hands, exactly as it is
said to have been done in Judea.</p>

<p>After breakfast we proceeded along the base of
the large hill upon which Ankobar stands, the road
winding around its south and west aspects. We then
fell into the usual high road on the west of the town,
which proceeds along the steep face of the valley,
midway between its crest and the level of the stream
below. We crossed, by gentle undulations of the road,
several short projecting spurs, all of which seemed
to be the productive farms of industrious individuals.
Thatched residences of mud and sticks, with yellow
stacks of grain, were perched upon their extremities,
overlooking the sudden cliff-like termination
of these subordinate ridges, cut by the action of the
constantly running water of the Airahra.</p>

<p>Fording this river, we commenced the fatiguing
ascent of the Tchakkah, and after little less than
an hour’s trot were breathing ourselves at the
“resting stone,” Koom Dingi. After a short halt,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
we continued our journey over the moor-like
solitary fields that, unbroken by hedge, stone fence,
or ditch, appeared in endless succession before us.
But the reader must understand that, although the
general appearance of the country is so flat, he is
only reminded of it by the long level lines
that bound the view on each side, for, generally
speaking, the road lies in broad shallow water-worn
channels, which, like hollow ways with banks ten or
twelve feet high, have intersected in all directions
this formerly undeviating level country. I always
fancied that at one time it must have been the bottom
of a deeply rolling sea, and what adds considerably
to this impression is, the almost total absence of trees,
and the bald, gray, stony, appearance of the stratum
of light coloured porphyritic trachyte which overlies
the whole country, and which looks as if it had
only been raised from the waters a short time
before. This super stratum of rock is very easily decomposed,
and forms a fertile soil for the cultivation
of wheat and barley, but its general appearance,
unless covered with the crops, is quite the reverse.</p>

<p>About half way to Angolalah we crossed two or
three of the earlier tributaries of the Barissa, which
is a small river that collects the waters falling to
the west of Tchakkah, and conducts them to the
Abi or Nile of Bruce. All streams to the east
of Tchakkah descend precipitously to join the
Hawash. The Barissa derives its name from having
been, previous to the reign of the present Negoos, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
“boundary” between the Gallas and the Christian
inhabitants of Shoa. It passes to the west of
Debra Berhan, flowing towards the north, and joins
the Jumma in the district of Marabetee. The
Jumma also receives the Tcherkos river, or Lomee
wans, which is now the western boundary of the
kingdom of Shoa, the district intervening between
it and the Barissa, a distance of about sixteen
miles, having been annexed to his dominions
within the last few years by Sahale Selassee. The
Jumma, after receiving the Barissa, and other
streams, of the kingdoms of Amhara and of Shoa,
joins the Abi near where that river, after flowing
to the south from Lake Dembea, turns suddenly to
the west, and forms the southern border of the
province of Gojam.</p>

<p>We arrived at Angolahlah before noon,
and Walderheros took me to the house of a
friend of his, named Karissa. The weather,
although only the latter end of June, was dreadfully
cold, and being very tired and ill, I preferred
rolling myself immediately up in my bed-clothes,
consisting of two Abyssinian tobes, which my
servant had carried with him in a skin-bag, rather
than sit up to eat of some hard parched corn which
was set before me by one of the women of the house.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Walderheros went to the
palace to announce my arrival, and to request an
interview with the Negoos. It was a long time
before he returned, and I began to think, that like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Mr. Krapf’s servant at Farree, he might have been
imprisoned for aiding me in coming to Angolalah
without permission. In about two hours,
however, he made his appearance, bearing on his
head a large conical covered straw basket, which
contained a flat loaf of excellent wheaten bread.
With one hand he steadied this load in its elevated
position, whilst in the other, he carried by a strong
loop handle of rope, a round earthenware pot, the
contents of which were as yet a secret to me.
Across one shoulder was also slung an enormous
bullock’s horn, the diameter of the base of which
was not less than seven inches, full of an agreeable
sweet wine, called “tedge,” made of honey, and not
at all a bad beverage. I was astonished at the
ease with which he seemed to have procured these
provisions; and the visions of my Dankalli servant
in Adal and the representation I had seen of the
Egyptian god, Harpocrates, similarly burdened,
recurred to my mind, as the abundance of the land
I was in, was illustrated by the appearance of
Walderheros on his return from the palace. Besides
the refreshments that he bore himself, he was
followed by a stream of people, two of them carrying
a tressel for my bed, another an oxskin to throw
over it, then came others with fire-wood, also
two women with large jars of water, and the
procession closed by four men bearing a small black
tent of coarse woollen cloth, which was set up in a
very short time, for my accommodation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
When I had taken possession of my new
quarters, the tent was thronged for the rest of the
day by curious or busy people, some bearing messages
for Walderheros from the palace; others,
making anxious inquiries as to my reasons for
coming to Angolalah; and not a few were begging
of me to intercede for them with the Negoos, to
reinstate them into his good graces, which, for
some dereliction of duty it seemed, they had lost;
and now hoped that by my mediation their sins
would be forgiven. Two superior officers of the
household of the Negoos, also sat with me nearly
the whole day, Waarkie, an Armenian, long
resident in Shoa, and Sartwold the chief of the
“affaroitsh,” or distributors of the rations to stranger
guests. The former understood a little Arabic, and
we managed to converse together very well. He
told me, that instead of my being sent out of the
kingdom, he was quite certain I should become a
great favourite with the Negoos. The order sent
for my removal from Aliu Amba, was occasioned by
the ill-natured un-English representations of the
officers of the Embassy who had told Waarkie
himself, that I did not belong to their party, that
they did not know who I was, and adding, to assist
me still more, that I was very poor, and could give
no presents to the Negoos. I felt very much hurt,
and annoyed, at these unfair representations, and
produced a letter which I had received from the
Indian Government in Calcutta, addressed to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
princes in Africa, who were friendly disposed to
England. This I had previously kept back from a
feeling of delicacy towards our representative at the
Court of Shoa, but now determined to forward it
to the Negoos by Sartwold, who readily consented
to carry it up to the palace, Walderheros accompanying
him to bring me back the answer.
Waarkie, who could not read the Persian character,
in which the letter was written, went in search of
some Islam visitor at Court, who would be able to
translate it for the Negoos.</p>

<p>As evening now closed in, I retired to rest;
sometime after which my servant returned with the
letter, and a couple of lemons sent by the Negoos,
with a message that I should be called on the
morrow to an interview with him.</p>

<p>Long before it was light, I was awakened by
loud shouts of “abiad,” “abiad,” raised at short
intervals, and apparently at some distance. On
applying to Walderheros for an explanation of this
uproar, he made me understand with some difficulty,
that it arose from the petitioners for
justice, calling upon the Negoos to hear them. It
appears that after a case has been heard in the
lower courts, if they may be so called, held before
the governors of the town in which the conflicting
parties reside, if either complain of his decision,
an appeal may be made to the king himself. A
company of the friends of the dissatisfied assemble,
in as great a number as the influence of the party
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
or the justice of the case can collect. These
sometimes, so early as midnight, take up a position
on a height overlooking the town, and opposite to
that on which the palace stands. Half-a-mile, at
least, intervenes between the two places. Here
they keep up a continual shouting “abiad,”
“abiad,” (justice,) until a messenger from the
Negoos comes to know the nature of their complaint,
and to introduce them into his presence.
On this occasion, I did not understand sufficient of
the language to learn the particulars of the case,
but as the Negoos is the most easily accessible, the
most patient listener, and the most upright judge
that I ever heard praised by word of mouth, or
read of among the most laudatory history of kings,
I have no doubt that the cry of his people that
awoke me this morning was duly attended to, the
case investigated, and the strictest justice awarded.</p>

<p>The Dankalli may well style Sahale Selassee, “a
fine balance of gold,” for even now, when thinking of
his character, the most lively pictures recur to my
mind of instances of his kindness and feeling for
the happiness of his subjects, which I have
witnessed myself. Excepting the cruelty, and
dissimulation, practised towards the unfortunate
tribes of Gallas who surround his dominions, and
which he has been taught to consider from his
childhood, to be praiseworthy acts, which will
secure the approbation of God; excepting this,
nothing in his character can, I think, be justly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
assailed. The fears of his Christian, and the hopes
of his Islam subjects, that he would renounce the
faith in which he has been brought up, and profess
Islamism, redounds considerably to his character as
a reflecting man, and a proof of the really
capacious mind he possesses; for none who are
aware of the gross superstition and confusion most
confused, of the tenets of the Greek Church as
professed in Abyssinia, can feel surprised that a
naturally sagacious mind, should refuse the trammels
of absurdity and error, to embrace the reasonable
simplicity of the profession of one true and
only God, which is the real basis and great recommendation
of the Mahomedan belief.</p>

<p>It is the false consolation of an easily-satisfied
Christianity to believe, that the licentiousness, which
an abuse of the Mahomedan religion most certainly
encourages, is the chief inducement which converts
so rapidly, whole states to the profession of
the Islam faith. A little observation soon proves,
that although the sensual indulgences it sanctions,
and the promises contained in the Koran, enlist the
worst passions of man in favour of its continuance,
when once that religion has obtained a firm hold
upon the opinion of a people; still, that these
causes have but little influence in effecting a change
from a previous belief.</p>

<p>Wherever a patriarchal, or even a feudal government
exists, there the mass of the people are
directed in their conduct, and in their ideas of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
right and wrong, entirely by the leading minds
that circumstances have made their superiors.
The doctrine that “the king can do no wrong,”
appears to be a traditional continuance of this blind
confidence in the ruling powers which characterized
the state of society in Europe, at an early
date; and which is still, to this day, the universal
principle of government in all native African
states. In that Continent, sagacious and intelligent
princes, concentrate the energies of extensive
empires, but at their decease, revolutions occur to
re-adjust the limits of power again, according to
the capabilities of the various ambitious claimants
that may spring up. The greatest minds obtain the
largest dominion, and when these appear among the
professors of superstitious religions, soon feel a contempt
for the absurd pretensions and the moral
falsehoods their superior mental powers instinctively
detect. Too frequently, having no idea of a rational
system of theology, but aware of the value of religion
as an engine of state policy, they wisely profess and
encourage the ancient faith. Let, however, a doctrine
be preached that is more adapted to reason
and common sense, and which promises equal
security to the continuance of social order and of
kingly rule: its professors in that case are always
found to be received into the highest favour by
wise and sagacious princes, who perceive in the
new opinions upon an important subject, that satisfaction
of the reason which the absurd representations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
of superstitious religion have only disgusted or
amused. Such princes converted to a rational
belief, have but to promulgate their adhesion to be
followed by the whole of their courtiers, who again
impose it upon their dependants, from whom the
process passes on to their slaves, and one universal
obsequiousness characterizes the conversion of people
so situated.</p>

<p>This was the principle that led whole states of
Europe, in the earlier feudal ages, to be baptized
together, and which, at the present time, is the
chief cause of the fast progress of Mahomedanism
in Africa. Princes of extraordinary powers of
intellect are first converted, who, in the simple
unembodied unity of the Deity perceive no
absurdity, nor yet dare to deny. Atheism is a sin
peculiarly of civilization, for the nearer man
approaches barbarism the more predisposed he
becomes to a belief in a Providence; and this, in
fact, distinguishes him, in his most abject state, from
the beasts of the field who defile the inanimate idols
he in his ignorance bows down to and worships.
The Christianity of Abyssinia is a religion spoiled
by human intervention; it appears to be a faith too
pure for the nature of the inhabitants, and they
have accordingly disfigured it to reduce it to their
condition. Abyssinians have, by their abuse of the
revered name of the Redeemer of mankind, brought
his religion into contempt; whilst the professors of
Islamism respect Jesus as a prophet, and profess to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
worship the Deity he adored. Is it, therefore, to
be wondered at, that princes of superior intellects
should reject the former and adopt the latter faith,
as we know to have been the case with the previously
Christian King of Enarea, who, within the
last few years, has professed the Mahomedan belief.
Sahale Selassee, the monarch of Shoa, universally
acknowledged to be the greatest of Abyssinian
potentates, was on the verge of a similar repudiation
of the religion of his predecessors, when the
worthy and exemplary missionaries, Messrs. Isenberg
and Krapf appeared in his country. I am too apt
to feel the zealot, but every one must admit with
me, that that important visit was not a human
ordination, for Sahale Selassee’s conversion would
have been the downfall of the Christian religion in
Abyssinia. Even the political mission to Shoa,
which has failed in its proposed objects, yet affords
some consolation by supposing that the evidences
of our wealth and power, demonstrated by the
presents which were laid at his feet by our representative,
will confirm him in his renewed attachment
to our religion, which only requires his countenance,
to contend successfully in Abyssinia against
the encroachments of the Islam faith, until fresh
efforts shall be made by the friends of the Gospel
in this country, more firmly to establish the pure
faith of Christ in that <em>benighted</em> land.</p>

<p>Among more savage tribes, again, Islamism has
other recommendations, for the missionaries of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
religion, the merchants from the sea-coast who
journey in to the interior of Africa, are immeasurably
more affluent than the chiefs whose territories they
visit. Besides, the imposing effect of publicly
praying, the apparent devotion of their many genuflections
and prostrations, the splendid finery of
their large rosaries, added to which, their great
ostentation of wealth where personal security is
assured, soon influence the poor, ignorant, and wondering
natives. The Islam factor is confessedly the
greatest man among them; and his manners are
copied, and his creed adopted, by the operation of
the same human feelings, which in England or
France make a <em>lion</em> or constitute a fashion, with
this recommendation on the part of the savages,
that their admiration is by far the most permanent.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>June 30th.</i>—This morning, after a breakfast of bread
and cayenne pottage, which proved to be the contents
of the little earthenware jar carried back from
the palace the day before, I was sent for, to present
myself immediately before the Negoos. Understanding
that it was etiquette to appear before
royalty either with the upper part of the body,
above the waist, quite naked, or else, on the contrary,
closely clothed up, I chose the latter alternative,
and put over my blowse dress my black
Arab cloak, and following the messenger, walked
up the side of the low hill upon which the Palace
of Angolahlah stands. This ridge, scarcely one
hundred feet high, is a red ferruginous basaltic
dyke, which has here protruded through the
general surface rock of grey columnar porphyry.
The rock of which it consists contains so much iron
as to render the compass completely useless in
taking bearings, and the oxidization, where it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
exposed to the action of the atmosphere, occasions
the bright red colour of the hill. The circumscribed,
but nearly level summit, is occupied by the
several courts of the royal residence, the palace
buildings, long thatched houses, standing in the
centre of all.</p>

<p>An irregular stockade of splintered <i>ted</i> (a juniper
pine), twelve or fourteen feet high, is carried around
the edge of the ridge, and the enclosed area, in its
longest direction, exceeds three hundred yards.
This is subdivided into courts, the first of which is
entered from the town by a low gateway that
scarcely affords passage to a person mounted upon
a mule, although it is a privilege of the principal
courtiers to ride so far before they dismount, when
they visit the Negoos.</p>

<p>Through this court we passed, for about twenty
yards, between two rows of noisy beggars, male and
female, old, middle-aged, and young; who, leprous,
scrofulous, and maimed, exhibited the most disgusting
sores, and implored charity for the sake of
Christ and the Virgin Mary. I was glad to escape
from their piteous importunity, and I passed quickly
through another row of palings by a narrow wicket
into a second court, something more extensive than
the other, where I found a crowd of people
listening to an orator, who, with shoulders and
body bare to his middle, was addressing three or
four turbaned monks who sat in an open alcove,
beneath the long projecting eaves of a thatched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
roof. This I was given to understand by Walderheros,
who followed close behind me, was a court
of justice, from whose decision, if the parties did
not feel satisfied, they appealed to the King. As
we passed through a third wicket, a small enclosure
on one side attracted my attention, from the circumstance
of several prisoners, shackled by the wrists
and ancles with bright and apparently much-worn
fetters, endeavouring to get a peep at me through
the interstices of their wooden prison. In the
next court was collected a great heap of stones,
upon which a number of people were sitting; and
here also I was desired to be seated, as I found out,
among the noblemen of the country; for at first I
objected to such a lowly couch, until I saw the
Wallasmah, whom I knew to be the most powerful
of any of the subjects of Sahale Selassee, sitting
very contented, wrapt up in his white tobe, his black
bald head, little eyes and snub nose, alone appearing
from above its ample folds. There were many others
of nearly equal rank, who were waiting to see the
Negoos; so choosing the sunniest spot unoccupied,
did in Shoa as I saw the Shoans do, and sat down
with the rest upon the hard stones.</p>

<p>I had scarcely comported myself so unassumingly
when its due reward followed, by being summoned
immediately afterwards into the presence of the
Negoos. I found his majesty in the next court,
which was nearly circular, and surrounded by a low
stone wall instead of the high, ragged palisades, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
three times before fence his retreat about. Several
long low houses stood around, serving as stores and
offices, and conspicuous among them was the little
round cottage, about twenty-two feet in diameter,
that was then being erected by Capt. Graham.
One of the thatched houses was raised to a second
story, open in front, each side of which was ornamented
with trellicework of very rude carpentry.
In this elevated alcove, upon a couch, covered with
red velvet, and reposing upon large cushions of
yellow-coloured satin lay the Negoos of Shoa, Sahale
Selassee, whilst many-coloured Persian carpets
covered the floor, and hung over outside into the
court.</p>

<p>I uncovered my head after the most approved
court fashion, at least as far as I knew anything of
the matter, but a slight movement of the considerate
monarch instructed me that he desired I should
keep my cap on whilst standing in the sun, addressing
me at the same time by an Arabic expression,
signifying “How do you do.”</p>

<p>This mode of commencing the conversation rather
puzzled me, for simple as was the salutation, I had
forgotten the meaning of “<i>kiphanter</i>” and fancying
it to be some Amharic word, turned for assistance to
Walderheros, who, however, dropped his nether jaw,
and looked a vacant “I don’t know; don’t ask me.”
Waarkie, who stood with numerous other courtiers
around the royal couch, came to the edge of the
stage, and repeated the word, upon which, recollecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
myself, I bowed in return, and taking out
my letter I had received in Calcutta, held it up for
Waarkie to take it, and hand to the Negoos, as I
hoped from his being so conversant with Arabic,
he might be able to decipher it without the aid of
an interpreter. This, however, I soon saw he could
not do, for upon looking at it, not being able to
make anything of it the right way, he turned it
upside down, to see if it would read any easier in
that position. Two mollums, or learned Mahomedan
scribes, attendants of the Wallasmah Mahomed,
were now summoned, but they soon confessed
themselves at fault with the Persian character.
Very fortunately for my reputation, a large round
Government seal occupied one-third of the paper,
and some of the characters upon it being recognised
as Arabic, the document at length was reported
to be genuine, or I should have been set down as
an impostor as well as an adventurer. The seal
having thus impressed them with the official character
of the letter, the mollums satisfied the King
that they could make out that I was represented in
it to be a good man, and after one of them had
been instructed to ask me what presents I had
brought for the Negoos, they were ordered to
depart.</p>

<p>Having understood from the members of the
Mission, on my first arrival, that it was an invariable
custom, on introduction to the monarch, to make
him some present, I had accordingly provided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
myself with a few yards of rich Chinese silk velvet,
and a curiously-worked bead purse, which contained
a stone ring, cut out of a piece of green-coloured
jaspar. Each was handed up in succession to the
Negoos for his inspection; after having been duly
described and registered upon a strip of parchment
by a scribe who stood at my elbow for that purpose.
As each was presented, the Negoos slightly bowed,
and said, in his own language, “<i>Egzeer ista</i>” (God
return it to you).</p>

<p>A short conversation with his courtiers, who stood
with the upper parts of the body completely uncovered,
was followed by a request on the part of the
Negoos, that I should ask from him whatever I
desired. I begged to be allowed to remain in Shoa
until after the rains, and then to have permission
and his assistance to proceed to Enarea. A slight
inclination of assent, with an abrupt recommendation
of me to the care of heaven by his majesty,
terminated the interview, and I retired, followed
by Walderheros, who appeared highly delighted
with the graciousness of my reception, and was
evidently speculating upon the bright prospects
before him from the opportunities I might have of
pushing his fortunes at court, for the precincts of
which he seemed to have a great predilection.</p>

<p>Immediately after returning to my tent, a large
goat was sent to me by the Negoos, and an inconvenient
command that I should remain for the day at
Angolahlah. There was nothing that I desired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
less, for the cold weather, the thin shelter of the
tent, and my expected attack of the fever paroxysm
on this day, made me anxious to proceed at once,
after my visit to the palace, to my comparatively
comfortable quarters in Aliu Amba, where the
climate was so much more temperate and agreeable.
I sent Walderheros to report the circumstance of my
being very ill, and he fortunately met Tinta, who
was coming down to see me, having been appointed
to act as my “balderabah.” This is an officer who
attends to the wants of a stranger guest, and is
responsible to the Negoos for any neglect of the
duties of hospitality. He also is the channel of
communication between the monarch and his
visitors, nor can any other person of the royal
household undertake the duties of, or become the
deputy of another in this office, so that it not unfrequently
happens that an inconvenient detention in
one of the courts of the palace takes place, if the
balderabah happens not to be present to announce
to the Negoos the presence or the business of his
client. As the balderabah is always chosen from
among the principal men about the court, the office
is somewhat analogous to that of the patrons which
characterized the state of society among the ancient
Romans. The signification of the name “balderabah,”
in the Amharic language is, the master or
opener of the door.</p>

<p>Tinta came down, and after announcing to me
that I had permission to remain in his town, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
that he was appointed my “friend at court,” gave
into my hand a little piece of parchment, about
an inch and a half square upon which was written
in the Geez language, “Give to this Gypt, eating
and drinking,” nothing more, but which constituted
me a “<i>balla durgo</i>,” that is, master or receiver of
rations. “Gypt,” the Amharic for Egyptian, is the
cognomen generally applied to all white men who
visit Abyssinia, they being supposed to come from
Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The durgo, or rations, supplied to strangers
whilst resident in their country, is a general custom
among Abyssinian princes, and is of very great
antiquity. It is considered that all persons visiting
the kingdom come only as friends of the monarch,
who, in the exercise of his hospitality, takes upon
himself the whole expense of their sustenance, so
that no excuse may be made for intriguing or interfering
in the ordered state of things, as regards the
rule or security of the kingly power. A deviation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
from the policy of non-interference on the part
of the guest would then be justly considered an
act of great ingratitude; nor when such a conservative
principle is involved in the observance of
hospitality towards strangers, can we be surprised
at the indignation which marks several tirades in
the productions of the ancient poets, when this
custom was more general than in modern times,
against individuals who have thus erred in their
duties to the hosts who have entertained them.</p>

<p>Moreover, when departing from an Abyssinian
country, the audience of leave-taking is supposed
to terminate with a blessing bestowed upon the
king by the guest, who acknowledges in this
manner the kindness with which he has been
received. The blessing being withheld implies the
reverse, and no little uneasiness and superstitious
alarm would be occasioned in the mind of a
monarch, by the idea that the stranger would
revenge himself by a curse, for any neglect he may
suppose himself to have been treated with.</p>

<p>These customs being borne in mind, to apply our
knowledge of them usefully, we must compare
them with similar observances which did, and still
do, characterize some oriental courts; and readers
perhaps will recall to mind some in the histories of
ancient and modern Asiatic monarchies, that may
have originated from some former connexion in one
extensive empire, of the now very different and
widely separated countries in which such customs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
are still retained. I shall content myself, however,
with pointing out their strict accordance with
similar usages at the court of Pharaoh, as recorded
in Genesis, and which is well illustrated in the
reception of the patriarch Jacob, at the court of
that monarch. In the forty-seventh chapter of that
book, Joseph from his connexion with the monarch,
introduces his five brethren, but he first reports
their arrival and obtains leave; and in nearly the
same manner he acts as balderabah of Jacob, and
the remainder of the family whom we find on their
arrival were constituted <i>balla-durgoitsh</i> “receivers
of rations,” for we read in the same chapter that
Joseph “nourished his father, and his brethren,
and all his father’s household with bread according
to their families.” We are also told when Jacob
retired from the presence of the monarch, “that
Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before
Pharaoh.”</p>

<p>At the hazard of being considered tedious, I
shall here allude to two other instances of customs
existing at the present day in Abyssinia, and which
are intimately connected with the subject we are
upon. The only public oath used by the inhabitants
of Shoa, is of a remarkable character. “Sahale
Selassee e moot.” ‘May Sahale Selassee die,’ if
such a thing be not true! is the constant ejaculation
of a protesting witness, or a positive informant;
and if upon a serious business, the immediate
confiscation of property, and incarceration in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
prison, would be consequent upon a perjured
imprecation made against the life of the Negoos.
Joseph, accusing his brethren, in the fifteenth
verse of the forty-second chapter of Genesis, says,
“Hereby shall ye be proved: <cite>By the life of
Pharaoh</cite> ye shall not go forth hence, except your
youngest brother come hither;” and again, in the
next verse, “or else <em>by the life of Pharaoh</em> surely
ye are spies.” The very language substituting
the name Sahale Selassee for that of Pharaoh,
under similar circumstances, which would be used
in the court of Shoa at the present day.</p>

<p>In the years 1830 and 1831, when cholera made
its circuit of the whole earth, it visited the kingdom
of Shoa. It was preceded for two successive years
by a great failure of crops, both of grain and
cotton, and the people in consequence, were reduced
to the greatest extremity for food and clothing.
Numbers fell victims from hunger alone, and to
relieve their necessities, numerous acts of violence
and robbery disturbed the usually peaceful state of
society in Shoa. The Negoos, at this time, secured
to himself the love of his subjects by the liberality
of his frequent distributions of grain; but another
calamity made its appearance, the cholera commenced
its ravages, and he began to fear that
his bounty must end by the exhaustion of his
means. The famine increasing from want of
the cattle which had died, to cultivate the land,
the difficulty of obtaining food began also to be felt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
by those who had the means of purchasing it, and
these intruding with their applications were supplied
at a price, whilst the wretched poor were left to
die. In this position, having nothing to dispose of
but their labour, a starving multitude of some thousands
appealed to the Negoos to grant them food,
and in return to receive their freedom, or at least
their services for life. This was granted, and even
after the cholera had swept off nearly two-thirds of
their number, above a thousand such individuals were
found to be in bondage to the Negoos, and duly
registered as slaves. This condition was certainly
little more than nominal, for, except upon extraordinary
occasions, such as constructing the bridge
dams over the streams on the roads to Angolahlah,
and to Debra Berhan, or when employed building
stone enclosures for the Negoos, a service scarcely
ever exceeding three days in three months, this
class of slaves were never called upon for regular
or long-continued labour.</p>

<p>In the course of the ten succeeding years, however,
children were born to these people, and the
question then arose, as to whether they shared the
bondage of their parents, or were free. This was
brought to issue by the Negoos bestowing certain
lands, upon which were domiciled several of these
bondsmen, upon a courtier, who made a demand of
service from the children, which the parents refused
to admit as his right, and an appeal was
made to the Negoos in consequence. The court of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
“<i>Wombaroitsh</i>,” or judges of an inferior kind, who
relieve the king of all first hearings of cases, except
in most important ones, and who sit in judgment
in one of the courts of the palace, decided
in favour of the children; but this decision, on an
appeal by the courtier, was negatived by the
Negoos himself, without any hearing of those unfortunates
who were most interested. The “<i>Wombaroitsh</i>”
put in a plea, however, founded upon the
canons of their Church, and the numerous solicitations
of the free relations of the bondpeople, induced
the Negoos to acknowledge himself to
have been in error, and to proclaim that the people
alone, whom he had fed and clothed in the time of
the famine, were his slaves for life, and that their
children for the future must be considered free.</p>

<p>These circumstances I became acquainted with
in consequence of having the daughter of one of
these very bondsmen in my service, and who was
old enough, at the time of the famine, to recollect
the sad miseries that fell upon her own family during
its continuance, until her father and two brothers
sold themselves for their food, in the manner I have
above related, to the future service of the Negoos.</p>

<p>Among others who addressed the Negoos in
favour of the children, whose numbers amounted
to scarcely more than five hundred, were the
officers of the British Mission, a fact, however, of
which I never heard until my arrival in this
country, nor is it, I am afraid, very generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
known to have been the case by the inhabitants of
Shoa, who have no other idea but that it was the
effect of religious feeling, and of the great sense of
justice, for which their sovereign, Sahale Selassee,
is celebrated all over the eastern horn of Africa,
and far into the interior towards the west.</p>

<p>I was never given to understand that the proclamation
that announced the freedom of the
children at all affected the condition of their
parents, who, I believe, still are and will continue
until death the bond servants of the Negoos.</p>

<p>When these circumstances were first related to
me, I could not help being struck by the exact
correspondence they exhibit, with the proceedings
of Joseph acting as the steward of Pharaoh towards
the starving Egyptians, during the infliction of the
seven years’ famine upon that country; and which
is another instance of the similarity of custom and
of situation between that ancient people and the
modern Abyssinians. The appeal, indeed, of the
former to Joseph, expresses exactly the request
made to the Negoos of Shoa by his subjects;
“Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both
we and our land? Buy us and the land for bread,
and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh,
and give us seed that we may live and not die, and
that the land be not desolate.”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> It is rather a singular circumstance that in England we apply
the term Gipsey to the descendants of an outcast people, and that
a name of similar origin should designate ourselves among the only
remnant of an Egyptian people that have preserved a national independency
in the country whither they had fled. It reminded me of
another ethnological fact I had observed in Aden, where the
flaxen-haired, light-coloured Jews, so different in appearance from
the darker complexioned Arabs among whom they lived, were
oppositely contrasted with those dark-eyed, dark-haired descendants
of Israel, who have retained these characteristics of an eastern
origin, although long resident among the fair-skinned inhabitants of
northern Europe.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> my “balderabah” Tinta, gave to Walderheros
the parchment order for durgo, he also told him,
as the tent was insufficient shelter for an invalid,
to take me to his house, which was not many yards
distant from where I was previously lodged.</p>

<p>Here we found his mother and sister sitting upon
the ground busy spinning cotton. The right thighs
of each were completely bare to the hips, for the
purpose of rolling swiftly with the palm of the hand,
along the smooth surface, the small light reel, which
hung revolving, whilst the hand bearing aloft the
light white cloud of cotton, slowly diverged to arms’
length, and the other as gradually drew out in the
opposite direction the slender thread that was formed
during the operation.</p>

<p>Within the hearth circle, that occupied the
centre of the apartment, a huge wood fire was
blazing away, the most comfortable looking thing
I had seen since leaving Aliu Amba. On the
farther side from the door was a raised couch, built
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
of stones and mud, and upon this a layer of fresh
cut grass was laid, and an ox skin was soon found
to throw over this dampish looking bed. All being
arranged, I was invited to sit down, my shoes and
socks being then taken off, the older lady, in
accordance with a very usual custom, washed my
feet in warm water, and I had already become so
used to their manners, that I did not now draw
back the foot, as at first I could not help doing,
from the salute that is always given when the
process is concluded.</p>

<p>Besides the goat which the Negoos had sent to
me, another supply of bread (like our own), butter,
cayenne pottage, and tedge, arrived towards the
evening, and although I was not able to enjoy the
good things myself, the family and Walderheros
fared sumptuously upon the viands thus abundantly
provided.</p>

<p>After sunset our party was joined by Tinta himself,
who had been detained during the day on
duty at the palace. He brought with him the
“ullica” of the “affaroitsh,” or superior of the
distributors of the rations, named Sartawold, “The
gift of the Son.” He was a regular smooth-faced
courtier, sleek and well fed, very quiet, and very
cunning. A conversation, not an extremely interesting
one, was kept up by means of an Islam
inhabitant of Aliu Amba, who had arrived in
Angolahlah during the day, and upon the strength
of having seen me in the market of the former
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
town, had now called to make inquiries after the
health of his old friend and intimate acquaintance,
the “Aliu Amba ahkeem.”</p>

<p>Among the things Sartawold wanted, was some
medicine for the Negoos, whom he did not hesitate
to assert, had a most disreputable complaint; but
as I did not think proper to understand him until
I knew something more of the particulars of the
case, he soon ceased making the request. Our
halting conversation terminated at length by his
getting up from the floor, where he had been
sitting upon an ox hide, and telling me that the
King desired me to remain at Aliu Amba till I
was quite well, and, in the meantime, I must learn
to speak Amharic. After recommending each
other a dozen times to the care of heaven, Sartawold
retired, but it was some time before I could
get the talkative Islam to leave me to my much-required
repose.</p>

<p>After an early breakfast next morning, Walderheros
prepared for our departure, rolling up my
plaid, Arab cloak, and two large Abyssinian tobes
that formed my bed clothes, and putting them all
into a large goat skin bag, in which they were
usually carried on occasions of leaving home for a
time.</p>

<p>I presented my female friends with a few small
strings of blue and gold coloured beads, which are
the kind most preferred by the Christian inhabitants
of Shoa. Of these beads they construct the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
more superior kind of “martab,” the particular symbol
of their faith; which, of some material or other,
they invariably wear. It sometimes consists merely
of a white or blue thread, tied around the throat,
but those in most general use are made of dark
blue silk, imported by the merchants of Giddem
and of Hurrah. This colour, once universally
worn, is not insisted upon at the present day, for
although it still continues to be considered the
most orthodox, the white and yellow coloured
threads of beads have become very fashionable of
late. The custom of wearing coloured “martabs”
bears some reference, I believe, to a personal distinction
between the Christian and Islam faiths,
established by some former Negoos; for red head
dresses of cotton cloth, and long red gowns, are
invariably the “outward and visible” sign of the
profession of Islamism, among the women of Efat,
and other Mahomedan provinces, as the blue
martab is of the Christian population.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock before we were fairly started,
but we soon lost sight of the palace hill, with its
crest of thatched roofs appearing above the bristling
stockade; and of its red flanks dotted with
squatting noblemen and courtiers, who in clean
white tobes sat enjoying the fresh air and the
genial influence of a morning sun. Walderheros
ran by the side of my mule, poising upon his head
the skin bag which contained my bed. When,
however, the view of Angolahlah was shut out by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the projecting shoulder of a low ridge, along the
base of which our road lay, his burden was transferred
to the crupper of my saddle, and relieving
me of my carabine, the respectful bearing of a
servant was changed for the familiarity of a tutor,
and one long lesson in Amharic again occupied the
way.</p>

<p>We reached Ankobar late in the afternoon, and
as I was completely worn out, and the mule was
tired also, I agreed to the proposal of Walderheros
that we should stay for the night at the house of a
married sister of his, the husband of whom was
the “ullica,” or the superior of those slaves of the
Negoos, whose duty it is to cut and carry wood
for the use of the royal residences.</p>

<p>The house was very conveniently situated at the
junction of the lower road, around the base of the
ridge of Ankobar, with the steep ascending one
that leads to the town on its summit.</p>

<p>Walderheros found his sister at home, with a fat
slave-girl, Mahriam, as her attendant and companion.
Musculo, the husband, was absent upon some duty,
but he appeared in the course of the afternoon, and
all endeavoured to make me as comfortable as they
could.</p>

<p>Their house was of the better sort, built of
splinted ted, and consisted of a central apartment,
with recesses formed by the division of the space between
two circular walls, which were placed at about
four feet distant from each other. In one of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
recesses was placed a bed-stead, covered with an ox
skin tanned with the bark of the kantuffa, which
gives to this kind of leather a red colour. A skin
so prepared is called “<i>net</i>.” The kantuffa is a
pleasing looking tree, and might be cultivated as a
lawn shrub in England. It is a species of acacia,
and the bright red seed vessels formed like those of
the English ash, remaining after the foliage disappears,
would diminish considerably, I think, the
dreary aspect of a shrubbery in that season.</p>

<p>In the other two recesses were numerous jars
containing ale, grain, and water, and side by side
stood four pedestal hand mills, in the rear of which
a hole, knocked through the mud and stick wall,
served the double purpose of a window and
chimney. The large circular hearth occupied
the usual situation, nearly in the centre of the
apartment, which was itself not more than twelve
feet in diameter. Two solid planks of the “<i>sigbar</i>”
tree, each of which had been cut with no little
labour from a single tree, formed a pair of folding-doors.
The hinges on which they revolved consisted
of strong projecting extremities on one side
of the top and bottom of each, which were received
into corresponding holes on the wooden lintel and
threshold. At night the two flaps were secured by
an iron hasp shutting upon a staple, that admitted
a kind of wooden linch-pin to be thrust through.</p>

<p>The <i>sigbar</i> tree, of which these doors were
made, is the principal forest-tree of Shoa, it sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
attains the height of one hundred feet, with a
diameter of not less than five feet. In flocks along
its crushing branches, the flying “<i>gurazo</i>,” a species
of monkey, makes the circuit of the forest, and to
watch them, as they take the most fearful leaps
from tree to tree, is most interesting. I have seen
the dam, with a young one held tightly to her
breast with one arm, exactly like a human being
would do, fearlessly dart from the greatest height
to the lower branch of a neighbouring tree, and
quickly gaining its summit, keep well up with
the rest, in their leaping progress.</p>

<p>Musculo being the “ullica,” or superior of the
wood-cutting slaves, I requested him to bring
some of the people of all the country to the south
of Shoa, that I might have the opportunity of
examining them. Whilst he was away, however,
my fever fit recurred, and I was under the agreeable
influence of a warm water emetic when he returned
with a large company of his charge. There were
Shankalli negroes from the extreme south and west,
and Gallas from the intermediate countries, red
Gurague people, and the bilious-coloured, from
Zingero and Enarea—all stood or sat around the
door-way, and I could have wished to have
transferred the whole lot to some ethnological
museum, to relieve me just at that moment from
taking notes. In fact it was impossible, and so
ordering Walderheros to give them two ahmulahs
to purchase some ale for their evening’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
entertainment, I dismissed the chattering crowd
until another day, when more favourable circumstances
would admit of my making particular
inquiries respecting their families, their nations,
and their tongues, sharpened as my appetite for
such information was by the clear idea of the
character of the country I had already received from
the dealer Ibrahim, and which I wished to confirm
by actual conversations with the natives of the
various countries, he had spoken of in his geography
of Southern Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Warm water, as an emetic in the first stage of
an ague, materially diminishes its violence, and
although I do not recommend it altogether as a
cure, I am bound to speak well of it as a palliative.
At night I recommend also to a patient, situated as
I was, to take doses of from twelve to fourteen
grains of Dover’s powders. It is better, however,
to compound this excellent febrifuge with sulphate
of magnesia, rather than the usual salt, sulphate of
potass, and that for reasons which are obvious.</p>

<p>One effect of the opium which is not sufficiently
insisted upon by practisers of medicine is its specific
effect upon the brain as a tonic. In small doses at
bed-time I found it invaluable, as decreasing that
congestion in the blood-vessels of the head which
attends the paroxysms of ague, and which adds
considerably to the severity of the attack. In a
severe sun-stroke from which I also suffered, I
found abstinence from food and small doses of
opium at night relieved me of all bad symptoms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
in the course of three or four days. Experience
has taught me these important facts, but as future
travellers cannot be supposed to have my note
books with them, I have recorded these hints for
their benefit.</p>

<p>After the reaction following the hot stage of
the fever, I felt quite certain a horn or two of
“tedge” honey wine would not do me any injury,
so sent Walderheros just before sunset to endeavour
to procure me some. I also gave Musculo a salt
piece to purchase fowls and ale, as my contribution
towards the entertainment, Walderheros and myself
were receiving in the house.</p>

<p>My servant soon breasted the high hill, and
fortunately was just in time to find a person in
authority, who, immediately he was shown my
durgo order, procured a large bullock’s horn full of
the sweet wine. The manufacture of tedge or
honey wine is a royal monopoly, and is not publicly
sold; of course there is a kind of conventional
license, not exactly smuggling, by which, for
double or treble its value, this beverage may be
obtained. Even then the purchased article is
probably the rations that have been preserved by
some carefully disposed guest of the monarch, who,
pouring his daily allowance of a bullock’s hornfull
into a large jar, collects a stock for a day of
rejoicing or for private sale. The process of brewing
tedge is simple enough; cold water being poured
over a few small drinking hornsfull of honey placed
in a jar, is well stirred up; to this is then added
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
a handful of sprouted barley, “biccalo,” scorched over
the fire, and ground into a coarse meal, with the
same quantity of the leaves of the “gaisho,” a species
of Rhamneæ, not unlike the common tea plant, and
an intense but transient bitter like gentian or hops.
The mixture being allowed to stand for three or
four days, ferments, and is generally drunk in that
state, but is then rather a queer kind of muddy
beverage, full of little flocculent pieces of wax. It
is more agreeable, but not unlike, in appearance
or character, very strong sweet-wort. To a superior
kind, made for the King’s own table, besides the
“biccalo” and “gaisho,” is also added a kind of berry
called “kuloh,” which grows not unlike the fruit
of our elderberry, and may possibly be the production
of some tree belonging to that species. The
jars containing this are sealed with a large cake of
clay mixed with the lees of the decanted liquor.
This kind of tedge is allowed to stand for several
months before it is used, and is called “barilla,”
from always being handed to guests in small
Venetian bottles of green glass, the fracture of one
of which is a grievous offence with his Shoan
Majesty, and he always makes the careless party
pay for it.</p>

<p>Two hours after sunset I was well enough to sit
up and partake of my tedge, which was handed to
me by Walderheros, to amuse myself with whilst
he proceeded to lay out our supper. A large
round table of wicker-work, the diameter of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
was about three feet, and about one foot in height,
was reached down from a peg, where it had been
suspended against the wall, and laid upon the floor
before me. In the centre of this, Eichess, the lady
of the house, placed a round saucer-like dish of
red earthenware, full of the cayenne pottage, which
had been long preparing upon the fire, and in which
were boiled to a hot fricassee the disjointed limbs
of a fowl. A separate heap of three or four of
the thin teff crumpets, folded four-fold, was then
put for each person.</p>

<p>Walderheros, for a few beads, had purchased at
the palace about a yard of yellow wax taper, which
was merely a long rag dipped into the melted
material. Having cut off and lighted a portion of
this, he carried it flaring about in his left hand, as
he assisted most busily in the arrangement of the
supper things. Musculo, not to be idle, had seated
himself upon one corner of the bed I occupied,
and with the bullock’s horn upon his knee occasionally
replenished my drinking horn, and as
frequently assisted me in finishing its contents.</p>

<p>Everything at length being pronounced ready, I
was requested to take my seat at the table, a boss
of straw being placed for my accommodation. I,
however, preferred remaining on the bed, watching
their whole proceedings for want of other amusement.
The company, who soon seated themselves,
consisted of Eichess, Mahriam, Walderheros, Musculo,
and a younger brother of the latter, named
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Abta Mahriam, one of the King’s gunmen, who
had come in during the preparation of the meal.
Musculo took the straw seat, the rest squatted
around the table upon their heels, and formed
altogether a good picture of an Abyssinian family.</p>

<p>Eichess commenced by dipping several folds of
the thin bread into the cayenne pottage until well
saturated with the condiment. With a quantity of
this she supplied each individual, taking for that
purpose the topmost layer of the heap of bread
assigned to them, which, after sopping, was returned
to its previous situation. The party now proceeded
on their own account, tearing off portions
of the under bread, and wiping it upon the
moistened morsel above, by the contact giving to
it the required hot relish, in a manner somewhat
analogous to our putting mustard upon meat.</p>

<p>The “wort,” or cayenne pottage, may be termed
the national dish of the Abyssinians, as that or its
basis, “dillock,” is invariably eaten with their
ordinary diet, the thin crumpet-like bread of teff
or wheat flour. Equal parts of salt and of the
red cayenne pods are well powdered and mixed
together with a little pea or bean meal to make
a paste. This is called “dillock,” and is made in
quantities at a time, being preserved in a large
gourd-shell, generally suspended from the roof.
The “wort” is merely a little water added to this
paste, which is then boiled over the fire, with
the addition of a little fat meat and more meal, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
make a kind of porridge, to which sometimes is also
added several warm seeds, such as the common
cress or black mustard, both of which are indigenous
in Abyssinia. When unable to make the “wort,”
a little of the “dillock” is placed <i lang="fr">en masse</i> upon
the bread, which the eater endeavours to make go
as far as possible by slight touches of each portion
of the food he puts into his mouth.</p>

<p>Whilst speaking of this article of food, it may
be as well to observe, that its use appears to
have been dictated by the situation of the Abyssinians.
As an easy illustration by analogy, it
may be safely supposed that salt is a more indispensable
necessary of life, and far more expensive
in that country, than the purest white sugar is in
Europe. Children stand around the mother whilst
engaged in any manner in which salt is employed,
as in England, little silent gazers are attracted
around mamma when making sweetened dishes.
Good housekeeping with the Abyssinians consists
chiefly in the economical management of their stock
of salt; and among other notable modes of making
a little do duty for a considerable quantity, besides
affording an additional stimulant to the palate, is
this system of combining it with pepper.</p>

<p>An old Dutch method of executing criminals was
confining them solely to the use of bread in which
no salt was contained, and which ultimately occasioned
death by the worms that were thus allowed
to generate in the intestines. Many children in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
England have I seen who have certainly fallen
victims to the foolish fear that they would eat
too much salt; and I believe that disposition to
scrofula, the national disease, is chiefly owing to the
vegetable diet of our children not being sufficiently
attended to in the matter of this simple condiment.
Be that as it may, the Abyssinians suffer
considerably in their health from the difficulty of
obtaining salt. They are dreadfully subject to that
species of <i lang="la">vermes</i>, called tapeworm, and every
month are obliged to have recourse to a vile drastic
cathartic called “cosso,” to get rid of the unpleasant
cause of this complaint, and all owing to the
want of sufficient salt in their food. To this cause
may be attributable also that tendency to form
large spreading ulcers which the slightest bruise
upon their bodies occasions; and the dreadful
ravages which syphilis makes among them.</p>

<p>The supper grew gradually to a close, and as the
viands disappeared, matter for conversation seemed
to increase. As the appetites of the party were
appeased, I noticed little choice bits of the fowl
that remained at the bottom of the “wort” basin,
were taken out by the fingers of the lady of the
house, and being rolled up in a mass of bread, far
too large for the mouth, were successively handed
to all around. Each one as he received the compliment,
slightly rising from the ground, kissed the
joined wrists of his own hands, as he offered to support
the hand of Eichess, whilst she held the morsel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
to the mouth, until it had entirely disappeared.
Mahriam, the slave-girl, who sat with the rest, was
not neglected, for a larger portion came to her
share than to any of the others. Slaves generally
are considered by their owners in the light of near
relations, or rather, perhaps, as foster children.
When their conduct is so very bad as to alienate
the affection of their indulgent masters, they are
not unfrequently dismissed. Latterly, however, a
greater relaxation in the principles of the Christians
of Shoa, as in other portions of Abyssinia, has led
to a punishment for refractory slaves, by selling
them to their Mahomedan neighbours, who soon
forward them to the coast. Canon law prohibits
this custom of selling slaves altogether, but a
system of smuggling in this unhappy commodity is
extensively carried on, by the very priests of the
religion itself, who are continually bringing slave-children
to Aliu Amba market from Gurague, and
other Christian states to the south of Shoa.</p>

<p>The repast being concluded, all wiped their
pottage-soiled fingers upon the last fragments of the
bread, which were then duly swallowed. Mahriam
now got up, and from out a gourd-shell poured a
little water upon the hands of each of the party, who,
rubbing the fingers together a little, then dried them
upon their ample tobes. A gambo of strong ale
called thalah, containing at least five gallons, was now
opened, and deep horn cups were frequently replenished,
whilst a lively conversation concerning the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
events of the last two or three days was kept up; a
very highly-coloured account of my reception by
the Negoos, no doubt, having been given by Walderheros,
who, as principal speaker upon the occasion,
was in the happiest mood possible, and though
generally very careful of his tapers on other occasions,
he found himself obliged to light the remaining
half-yard, to afford him time to conclude his
long narration.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> slept well during the night, in spite of the
very numerous fleas, and similar trifling annoyances,
to which I had become in some measure accustomed,
as must every traveller in Abyssinia, I arose,
like a giant refreshed; for one comfort, amidst all
the disheartening circumstances that oppressed me
was, that every other day was one of rest, on
which I was, comparatively speaking, well. A few
beads to Eichess and Mahriam, repaid them for
their attention, and my mule being brought, before
the sun had cast his first beams over the ridge in
front of Ankobar, I was following Walderheros
along a narrow winding lane, between high banks,
on which grew the broad-leaved banana-like
Ensete plant, and the thick coarse foliage of a
dwarf tree called, “y’ shokoko Gwomen,” the
rock rabbit cabbage. In a short time, we
emerged into the regular road to Aliu Amba,
called the lower road, in contradistinction to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
one that leads through Ankobar above, and after
an hour’s ride, I arrived upon the market-place
portion of the rock of Aliu Amba, long before
Walderheros, but the mule took me direct to my
old quarters at Miriam’s house, along the labyrinth
of lanes that would otherwise have sorely puzzled
me. Here I was received by a crowd of women,
who announced my arrival with a loud and long-continued
cry of “La, La, La,” a customary
welcome, never omitted on the return home of any
one who has been absent for a time. I subsequently
observed, that the more chance there was
of receiving an ahmulah to spend in ale afterwards,
the more joyous was the cry, and more numerous
was the assembly. Two native fiddlers also presented
themselves, immediately that I had seated
myself in the house, bringing with them their
instruments, and a little doll dressed up to represent
an Amhara soldier, with small but well-made
models of spear, shield, and the peculiar crooked
sword of the country.</p>

<p>Their fiddles were clumsy-looking affairs, consisting
of a long handle, a lozenge-shaped parchment
body, and one string formed of a loose
bundle of horse-hairs, that at the upper extremity
of the handle were secured to a moveable pin of
wood three or four inches long, and after being
carried over a bridge which stood upon one of the
parchment faces, were looped down to a little
projection beyond. The string thus formed, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
tightened at pleasure, by simply twisting it upon
the stick pin. The bows were caricatures of the
European ones, being little tough boughs of some
tree or other, bent into a semicircle, the two ends
being connected by a loose band of horse-hair of
the same character as the fiddle-string. A piece of
<i>attan</i>, or the frankincense of Arabia, served the
musicians instead of resin, and was kept in little
bags that were suspended by strings from the
handles of their instruments. A sharp pointed
stick being pushed into the ground, the doll was
fixed upon it so that it could move freely about.
It was then connected by a long string with the
bow of the fiddle, the motion of the one whilst
playing, making the other jump about in the most
approved Jim Crow fashion, to the great delight of
the naked, chattering, dark-skinned children, who
pushed their faces and little limbs among their
equally amused, but more staid elders, who
thronged the house to witness the performance.
When the musicians departed, a present of two
ahmulahs made them quite happy, and after they
were gone, and the greater part of the company
with them, Sheik Tigh and Hadjji Abdullah came
in to ask the news, and to hear about the success of
my journey to Angolahlah. Miriam, by dint of a
great deal of puffing at a little stick fire, before
which she knelt, managed at length, to prepare
some coffee. My pipe was filled, and Walderheros,
who in the mean time had come in, was sent to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
borrow another for Hadjji Abdullah. Sheik Tigh,
having some Wahabbee notions, did not indulge in
the fumes of tobacco, so he sat upon one of the
boxes, commenting upon and endeavouring to
explain by sundry guesses, the motives that could
have induced the Negoos, in the first place, to order
me out of the kingdom, and then treating me so
well when I went up to see him. It was concluded,
at last, that I was on the high way to state
preferment, which was presently confirmed by my
balderabah Tinta, much to my surprise, making
his appearance, bringing a message, not only to me,
but to Sheik Tigh. Three affaroitsh, or distributors
of durgo, accompanied him, bringing
presents of white wheaten bread, honey, and
butter. The two latter were in large earthenware
jars containing ten or twelve pounds each. The
message from the Negoos for me was to the effect
that I must learn the Amharic language as quickly
as possible, and to take plenty of medicine so that
I might be quite well to visit his majesty, on the
occasion of his visit to “Michael wans,” which
would be during the fast of Felsat, (the ascension
of the Virgin Mary,) about the beginning of the
next month, August. Sheik Tigh also received
an order to act as my “duptera,” or teacher, and
received a small piece of parchment like the one I
had received in Angolahlah, and which awarded
to him in return for the duty of attending to my
Amharic education, ten <i>cuna</i> of grain every month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
As I had then no more than sixteen dollars, all
of which I might be called upon to pay at any
moment to different parties of my escort and
Kafilah friends, I was in some measure obliged to
be dependent upon the hospitality of the Negoos,
upon whom the information that I was very poor
had a very contrary effect to what was intended by
the embassy. In fact, the chief object of Tinta in
following me was, to arrange with me in what
manner I would receive the durgo of bread and
wine which he, as Governor of Aliu Amba and my
balderabah, had to provide. Walderheros, upon
whose sagacity and honesty I could depend, advised
me that I should make a composition or agreement
with Tinta, that instead of receiving all the rations
of bread, honey, butter, &amp;c., to deliver which, daily,
at my house would have been very inconvenient to
him, I would take the same quantity of grain as
Sheik Tigh, and although three times more than I
should actually require for making bread, that
which would remain, Walderheros remarked, he
could easily exchange in the market for fowls or
sheep.</p>

<p>The proposition being both reasonable and convenient,
Tinta agreed immediately, but added, that
the honey and the butter coming direct from the
stores of the Negoos, he had nothing to do with them,
and they would be continued every month in the
same quantities that I had just received them, and if
this were not done, I was to complain to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
During the nine months I remained in Shoa, however,
this maintenance, which is considered equivalent
to the gift of a village, was supplied to me
monthly, as regularly as if I had sent my own
servant for it. The only deviation in this first
arrangement was when Sheik Tigh was taken
away upon some duty to Bulga, the ten cuna of
grain which he had received was then given to me
for the purpose of paying a fresh schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Tinta was a good-hearted man, very cautious in
his manner, and most faithfully attached to his <i>gaitah</i>,
Sahale Selassee, than whom, in his eyes, there could
not be a better or a greater monarch. For several days
he remained in Aliu Amba, and on some pretence
or other always came accompanied with Sheik Tigh
as his interpreter to spend the afternoon with me.
I soon perceived that the real object of these visits
was to learn the motive that had induced so many
Europeans to visit Shoa of late. About this time,
it must be observed, information had arrived of the
approach of M. Rochet de Hericourt bearing presents
from the King of France to Sahale Selassee.
I scarcely knew how to answer Tinta, except by
complimenting him upon the able character of the
Negoos, of which we had heard in our country, and,
induced us to desire a more intimate acquaintance
with a monarch of whom report spoke so highly.
This not appearing satisfactory, cupidity, the
national vice of Abyssinia, I thought might be
excited favourably for the explanation desired; so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
I entered largely upon the great commercial
benefits that would accrue to the Shoans by a communication
being kept up between their country
and the sea-coast. The very supposition of a road
being opened for this purpose seemed, however, to
astound Tinta, who, with a deal of sincerity in his
manner, begged of me, if I wished to remain on
good terms with the Negoos, not to mention such a
thing; for “how would Sahale Selassee,” he asked,
“be able to preserve his people, if they could escape
to countries so rich as yours.” To remove the
Adal and Galla tribes, Tinta considered would be
to break down the “hatta,” or fence, that alone
secured the Shoans at home, for they dare not leave
their country under present circumstances, except
with the greatest danger to their lives.</p>

<p>This subject-preserving principle appears to be
the most important one in the home policy of the
government of Sahale Selassee, It also appears to
have been the foundation of many ancient systems
of social communities, and the representatives of
which, preserved in their original purity, have yet
to be discovered in the unknown oases that stud
with desert-surrounded islands intertropical Africa.</p>

<p>In Shoa this principle is carried out for the sole
benefit of the monarch, and Paley’s metaphor of
the lording pigeon, over the productive wealth of
the whole dovecote, typifies exactly the respective
conditions of the Shoans and their Negoos. The
strictly selfish and monopolizing rule, established
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
by the sagacious monarch, has reduced all his
people to the most abject state of submission,
dependent upon him for every kind of property
they possess. Most fortunately for them, he is a
just and good man, for he can give and take away
at pleasure; and thus holding wealth and honour in
one hand, and poverty and wretchedness in the
other, he has made himself the point upon which
turns human happiness; and that kind of demon
worship which propitiates spirits supposed to have
the power of inflicting evil is, in consequence, paid
to Sahale Selassee, who could at any moment
reduce to a beggar the richest, and most powerful
of his slaves.</p>

<p>It is no fiction of the Shoan law, that everything
in the country is the positive property of the monarch.
He can, without assigning any reason, dispossess
the present holder and confer his wealth upon
another, or retain it for his own use. He can
demand the services of all his people at all times,
who must perform everything required of them,
to build palaces, construct bridges, till the royal
demesnes, or fight his enemies. They are, from
first to last, both rich and poor, the mere slaves of
one sole lord and master, and scarcely a day passes
over but in some way or other the most wealthy are
obliged to confess it, or run the risk of being
denounced as an enemy to the sovereign, which
would be followed by confiscation of all property, or
incarceration in Guancho, the State prison, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
heavy fine imposed. Nor do the Shoans, born and
educated in this servile condition, consider such
exercises of power as acts of tyranny; on the contrary,
with loud protestations of their own loyalty,
all the neighbours and late friends of the unfortunate
individual so punished would with one accord
ejaculate, “Our good King! Our good King!
alas! alas! to have such an ungrateful servant!”
meaning the dispossessed man of course.</p>

<p>Samuel’s expostulation with the Jews<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> when they
demanded a King, often recurred to me at the
various instances of what I at first considered to be
undue demands for ploughing, or gathering in the
harvest, or building store-houses for the Negoos,
which were made upon the people whilst I was in
the country, and who, at the bidding of the overseers
appointed to see the required work done, were
obliged to leave their own business, find their own
tools, material, and cattle, to perform whatever was
required.</p>

<p>“And Samuel told all the words of the Lord
unto the people that asked of him a king. And
he said, This will be the manner of the king that
shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and
appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be
his horsemen; and some shall run before his
chariots. And he will appoint him captains over
thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set
them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
and to make his instruments of war, and instruments
of his chariots. And he will take your
daughters to be confectionaries, to be cooks,
and to be bakers. And he will take your fields,
and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, even the
best of them, and give them to his servants. And
he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your
vineyards, and give to his officers and to his servants.
And he will take your men-servants, and your
maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and
your asses, and put them to his work. He will
take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
servants. And ye shall cry out in that day because
of your King which ye shall have chosen; and the
Lord shall not hear you in that day.”</p>

<p>Samuel very probably spoke from a knowledge
of the customs and practices of the kingly courts
in the countries surrounding Judea; and in that
case the principles of home policy which direct the
Sovereign of Shoa in governing his people, appear
to have come down to him from a very remote
time; nor can the unfair balance of power we
observe between him and his people be charged to
his own cunning and selfish intrigues. With the prejudices
inseparable from his education as a king, he
always feels jealous of his prerogative and of his
power, and the threatened diminishment in the
extent of either arouses his attention immediately.
He is perfectly aware that man’s nature will not
allow him to submit entirely to the arbitrary rule
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
of even the most just superior, and that some
spirits will always be springing up among his
subjects, the more numerous the greater the opportunities
may be, and who will endeavour to escape
from the bondage to which they have been born.</p>

<p>It is just possible to conceive the relation between
the monarch of Shoa and his people by comparison
with the state and condition of the household of
some rich and powerful nobleman in England; with
this difference, that in the latter case it is optional
on the part of the dependents to continue their
servitude; whilst the Negoos possesses the stronger
hold upon the services and property of his subjects,
and consequently a greater power of exercising his
will, because they have no means of removing
themselves away from his power. If opportunities
of escaping from this authority were afforded by
allowing free intercourse with other countries, this
would at once destroy that principle of dependence
which is the foundation of the kingly power in
Shoa, and which is perfectly understood to be so
by the Negoos, and every Shoan is also well aware
of the fact.</p>

<p>It can never be expected, therefore, that any
freedom of intercourse will be encouraged by Sahale
Selassee that is not connected with an increase of
his dominion. Give to him the ancient empire,
and he is our intelligent and useful ally; but this
clever prince of a petty kingdom will never afford
facilities for its being absorbed in any other empire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
The proffered friendship of a lion will always be
suspected by a sagacious old antelope.</p>

<p>A stranger, at first annoyed with the petty
restraints upon unlimited personal freedom, readily
excuses it when he finds this to be, part of the
cautious policy dictated by the exigences of a
government so constituted; and another thing
which leads him to feel more satisfied with his
situation in Shoa is, that he soon perceives Sahale
Selassee to be superior to the temptation of abusing
that power which he possesses. The contemplation
of such a prince in his own country is worth the
trouble and risk of visiting it. During a reign of
thirty years, save one or two transient rebellions of
ambitious traitors, who have led, not the subjects
of Sahale Selassee, but those of his enemies,
nothing like internal dissension or civil war have
by their ravages defaced his happy country; whilst
gradually his character for justice and probity has
spread far and wide, and the supremacy of political
excellence is without hesitation given to the Negoos
of Shoa throughout the length and breadth of the
ancient empire of Ethiopia. To be feared by every
prince around, and loved by every subject at home,
is the boast of the first government of civilized
Europe; and strangely enough this excellence of
social condition is paralleled in the heart of Africa,
where we find practically carried out the most
advantageous policy of a social community that one
of the wisest of sages could conceive—that of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
arbitrary power placed in the hands of a really
good man.</p>

<p>Although now experiencing the advantages of
virtue and wisdom directing the actions of Sahale
Selassee, the Shoans of the last generation were
exposed to the evils arising from the very opposite
character, and have had opportunities of comparison
between the disposition of the present
Negoos and the severe and merciless tyrant who
preceded him. All the older men who recollect
the rule of Wussen Saggad abound with tales of
the severe punishments, often unmerited, or
inflicted for moral faults of omission in duty,
rather than for the commission of actual
crimes; which, in fact, as might be naturally
expected under such a tyrant, were often
perpetrated by those of his courtiers, who more particularly
shared his favours. I saw some horrid
cases of the excision of noses, and of obliteration
of sight; unfortunates who had been doomed to
these punishments by their tyrannical master, intruding
themselves upon the traveller who visits
Shoa, in the vain hope of receiving some medical
relief. In one instance, I was requested by Sahale
Selassee himself to do what I could to relieve one
of these objects of his father’s cruelty, in whom the
rude excision of the nose had been followed by a
spreading cancerous sore over the whole face.</p>

<p>By these reflections and observations, noted down
when I was more than usually put out of my way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
by certain little acts of my servant; led me at last
to reconcile the apparent anomaly of a very rascally
proceeding, according to our ideas of social propriety,
being quite compatible in Shoa with real
fidelity, for my servant, the best that any man by
good fortune could have fallen in with, reported
every day to Tinta, whilst he remained in Aliu
Amba, every visit I made or received, and I could
not propose to go even to the next town for a morning’s
walk, but some reason would be found to defer
it until after a consultation with my balderabah, or
at least my intention made known to him.</p>

<p>This system of <em>surveillance</em> was most unpleasant
to me, because of the groundless suspicions it seemed
to betray; but I was sensible that my best policy
was to pretend not to see this jealous care, but by
every endeavour on my part, to deserve and secure
the confidence of a prince whom I admired for his
virtues, and the respect of a people, none but the
most depraved themselves, could help liking for their
simplicity, and for the extreme goodness of their
disposition.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> several days I continued to apply closely to
the study of the Amharic language. My fever
paroxysms on alternate days, became gradually less
violent, and my simple fare and regular habits
whilst living in Aliu Amba, seemed to promise the
re-establishment of my health. The only thing I
dreaded was the continual wet weather, which had
now set in decidedly.</p>

<p>In Shoa the rains commence in the month of June,
Messrs. Isenberg and Krapf say about the 21st,
and from the long residence of those gentlemen
in Abyssinia, they must be considered very good
authority. This year, the first rain that fell was on
the 7th of July, but this was an extraordinary irregularity,
for which the inhabitants could only
account by referring it to the presence of the
“Gypt sowitsh;” as subsequently, when it came
down in greater quantities than they desired, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
continued for a still more extraordinary long season.
This evil was also charged to their unlucky visitors,
many old monks having denounced the appearance
of the white men as being the threatening harbinger
of some coming evil.</p>

<p>On making some inquiries respecting the commencement
of the rainy season, Walderheros and
others, whom I questioned, stated the first day was
generally considered to be St. Michael’s-day, the
eighteenth of June, when the King distributes the
yearly clothing to his courtiers and slaves. This
custom may, in some measure, be determined by
the commencement of the rains, and in that case
the observation of the natives differs but slightly
from those of the English missionaries.</p>

<p>A severe thunder storm, attended by two distinct
shocks of an earthquake, at an interval of a few
seconds, ushered in the first heavy fall of rain. No
very serious consequences resulted; a few rocks
were detached from the heights above, blocking up
the narrow road to Ankobar in some places, and in
others, ploughing deep channels through the young
green crops. A few days previously to this convulsion,
the town of Ankobar, and the ridge on each
side of it, had been enveloped in clouds, that hung
low down the precipitous cliffs like immensely large
festooned curtains, which were now raised, and
again lowered, as the morning, mid-day, or afternoon
sun acted differently upon the temperature of
the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
An unpleasant circumstance was communicated
to me very feelingly during the storm on this
occasion. The straw roof of Miriam’s house was
a great resort of lizards, and their long serpentine
burrows in the thatch were so many irrigating
canals, all of which, for my sins, I suppose, according
to Abyssinian ideas of judgment, terminated
over my bed-place, and I found that unless something
was done to remedy this evil, either by
altering my course of life, or by applying more
straw to the roof, I must drag out the remainder
of my life in a shower-bath. As to getting well
of an ague under such circumstances, even my
sanguine disposition gave up the idea, and Walderheros,
whose fortune at court depended upon my
health being established, was shockingly excited
at this sad prospect of recovery, and was up and
looking into the matter immediately after the brief
thunder-storm had ceased.</p>

<p>The lowness of the walls facilitated his examination,
and stepping from the ground he essayed to
mount the roof, but the very next moment I saw his
black naked leg thrust quite through the frail stick
construction; filling the whole place with decayed
thatch and dirt, besides threatening my ribs beneath
the hanging foot, with no gentle application of his
heel, as he convulsively, but vainly endeavoured
to extricate himself. Fortunately, a straw-band,
which in his agony he had seized and held on by
as a centre of support, broke with the violence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the struggles he made to escape, and he was again
tumbled backwards out of the hole, head and neck
over on to the ground, quite as suddenly and as
expeditiously as he had before fallen into the
dilemma. Confounding his zeal, and that of all such
injudicious friends, I was in no humour to laugh
when he came in, covered with mud and broken
bits of straw, as if he had been tarred and feathered;
whilst the shouts and jeers of all the boys of the
neighbourhood, and Miriam’s high displeasure,
was all the return he got for the readiness
he shewed to risk in my service, his very heavy
carcase upon a rotten roof. An ahmulah was
the estimate of the damage done: Walderheros’
procuring for that sum straw sufficient to thatch
the whole roof afresh, and before night, such was
his dexterity, and that of some of the neighbours
who good-naturedly came forward to assist him,
the work was finished, and the house several
ahmulahs better for comfort, considering the season,
than previously to the accident.</p>

<p>A long coarse grass, called “cimbyllal,” three or
four feet long, which grows chiefly in what is
called, “Wana daggan middre,” that is land
situated between the “colla” or low land, and the
“daggan,” or elevated table land, is chiefly used
in thatching Abyssinian houses. Straw is too
valuable as fodder, to be so employed, even if its
broken and bruised condition after the grain has
been thrashed out, in the usual manner, by the feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
of oxen, admitted of its being so used. The
cimbyllal grass is cultivated in inferior soils, where
grain will not grow; but this convenience, I should
suppose, is not a sufficient recommendation for its
introduction into England, as an economical substitute
for straw for the purposes of thatching
cottages or littering cattle.</p>

<p>For some days I continued closely at my studies,
having procured, through the kindness of Dr.
Roth, some Amharic school-books, published by
the Church Missionary Society, and which were
compiled by the industry and the very creditable
zeal of the Rev. Messrs. Isenberg and Krapf, in
the discharge of their duties as missionaries of the
Gospel, and as agents for the diffusion of Christian
civilization. A geography which had been written
by the former gentleman in the Amharic language,
was particularly useful to me in acquiring a knowledge
of the meaning of many words, which would
otherwise have been a difficult business with a
native teacher, who knew nothing of English, and
but very little Arabic; although much more, certainly,
of the latter, than myself. The Amharic
signification of Arab words familiar to Sheik
Tigh, I soon learnt, and other names of visible
objects were as readily gained, but words expressive
of abstruse qualities I only acquired by reading
with him the geography; descriptive terms of well-known
subjects, conveying by a little exercise of
mind, the required words for other purposes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
application. With this work I therefore got on
very well, for one great advantage was, the interest
my teacher took in the subject, which, of all others,
next to sacred writings, is most calculated to excite
the attention of an active but ignorant mind.
Long after Sheik Tigh had given up his duty of
attending me, when he returned again to Aliu
Amba from Bulga, he reminded me of my promise
to bestow upon him my geographical lesson-book,
and I was pleased to see with what reverence he
received, and the care with which he prevented it
from receiving any injury, by making a strong
leathern case, in which he deposited it when not in
use.</p>

<p>This was not the only instance, I observed, of
the desire on the part of the people of Shoa,
both Christians and Mahomedans, to possess the
Amharic translations published by the Church
Missionary Society. The Christians, of course,
generally asked for the books of Moses, and of the
four Evangelists. Tinta, in return for some trifling
memolagee, or gift, desired me to procure him both
these works, but before I could oblige him, an
opportunity offered, of purchasing the latter in the
market. He immediately bought it, and the next
time he called upon me, one of his servants carried
the purchase before him in triumph, and I was
desired to get him a geography instead of the book
he had procured himself.</p>

<p>Tinta, in his character as my “balderabah,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
frequently brought me messages from the Negoos,
sometimes asking about my health, or wishing to
know if I required anything, “for was not Sahale
Selassee my father?” to supply me with whatever
I wanted in his country. After one of these visits,
Walderheros put me in mind, that a house of my
own would be very desirable. A very decent one
was vacant in the town, and the owner had offered
to sell it to me for five dollars, but not having any
to spare, I was obliged to decline purchasing it.
Walderheros’ suggestion, that I should ask the
Negoos to give me one, was a very sensible idea,
as I certainly felt I should be much more comfortable
in a house I could call my own, without
interfering with the ways and the convenience of
others. Miriam was particularly anxious that I
should make myself as much “at home” with her,
as possible; still I found, that Walderheros and
myself occupied the whole house, to the exclusion
of her and her two children. For the accommodation
thus afforded me, I paid a rent treble the
amount of what she would have received from any
one else; three ahmulahs a-week is considered a
most extravagant price for lodgings in Shoa, and I
gave Miriam two dollars a month, being ten
ahmulahs a-week. Unfortunately for me, Lieut.
Barker had resided in the same house nearly four
months, and having always had a plentiful supply of
cash, I could see my economical housekeeping
greatly disappointed the expectation of Miriam’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
friends, who, on my taking up my quarters in her
house had congratulated her on the favour of Allah,
which was so evidently shown to her by another
“Gypt” coming to reside with her.</p>

<p>The poor woman herself, however, was very
thankful for the few salt pieces I could offer her
weekly, and being sensible that it was only because
I had not more to give, she never annoyed me with
hints of disappointed expectations, or invidious
comparisons with the habits of my predecessor;
although others, who had no business to expect
anything from me, were much less delicate in their
allusions to the liberality of the “Kapitan,” who, to
judge by the kind inquiries respecting him, made
by male and female, old and young, seemed to have
been a universal favourite among the inhabitants of
Aliu Amba.</p>

<p>Walderheros, whose greatest weakness was to
be considered the servant of a most powerful and
influential master, felt any sneers at my poverty a
great deal more acutely than myself, and which,
after all, he generally excited himself, by his
assumption of importance, and the affectation of
swearing by my name, “Ahkeem e moot,” “may the
doctor die,” if a thing was not so and so, as if I had
been a magnate of the land; for besides swearing
by the life of the Negoos upon all important
matters, the dependents of Abyssinian noblemen
are accustomed, in private life, or on trivial occasions,
to asseverate the truth of anything by similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
imprecations upon the lives of their masters. This
practice has not a bad effect upon a listening
stranger, being a very pleasing characteristic of
the natural affection that ought to exist between
master and servant.</p>

<p>Several affronts that Walderheros had received
about my economy, and the small establishment
I kept up, determined him at length to
put it to Tinta himself, if such a scandalous
little place I lived in was fit for a friend of the
Negoos, and as I supported this expostulation
by a direct request to have a proper domicile
appointed for me during my stay in Shoa, my
worthy balderabah undertook to see the Negoos
next day about the matter. This was so far satisfactory
to Walderheros, who could now talk about
nothing else but my new house, and a large garden
which was to be attached to it, and where, according
to his account, teff grass, jowarhee, and cayenne
pepper plants would all flourish most advantageously,
especially as regarded my expenditure. According
to his account, there could be no question
about the success of my housekeeping. Everything
was propitious, and he amused me by the
manner in which he used to endeavour to convince
me how comfortable we should be. He had a
wife, and he had a slave girl, caught by himself
on some Galla expedition; besides these, I was
to buy a donkey, and then there was himself, all
of whom were to work like horses, and save me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
three ahmulahs a-week, about seven-pence halfpenny,
and, in fact, my whole expenditure, by his making
out, was to be a dollar a-month, one-half for his
wages during that time, and the remainder for the
purchase of poultry and sheep.</p>

<p>Tinta, in two or three days, brought a reply
from the Negoos, that I was to look out what
house would suit me, and if I were well enough
to visit him at Ankobar, where he was coming to
from Angolahlah, in the course of the week, he
would then give the necessary directions to put me
in possession of my choice.</p>

<p>Night and morning we were now to be seen,
Walderheros and myself, slowly walking along the
narrow confined lanes in search of a house that
would suit us. I leaning upon him on one hand,
and in the other, to assist in supporting my weakened
frame, I carried a slender rod, about seven feet
long, called a “zank,” in common use, as an aid
when walking, by the people of Shoa. We visited
every vacant house in the town to examine their
condition and character, and occupied ourselves
entirely by suggesting alterations and repairs, or
devising sundry projects of domestic comfort, in
connexion with the expected grant by the Negoos
of the one which I should prefer. For five or six
days we thus amused ourselves, and when the eve
of the day came on which I was to see the Negoos
at Ankobar, we were as far from having come to
a decisive choice, as upon the first day we commenced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
the search. Some were too old, some
stood in a crowded neighbourhood, the repairs of
others would have required an outlay of five or
six dollars, here the thatch was nearly all gone,
and there the garden was too small, and the last
was worse than all, for, by a curious accident,
the roof settled down on the top of us as we
entered, the wattled wall on the outside giving
way as we pushed open the dilapidated door to
get in. There was not one, in fact, that I could
fix my mind upon, and Walderheros being equally
difficult to please, we might have continued a long
time without coming to a decision, had not the
next day’s visit to the Negoos rendered it necessary
to fix upon some one, that I might be prepared to
answer the Negoos’s usual question, “What is it
you desire?” in return for the memolagee or offering
I had prepared for his acceptance, and which,
as it was of a peculiar kind, it shall be treated of
in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A custom</span> exists in every Abyssinian court, which
requires that no one shall go empty handed into
the presence of royalty. Every visitor to the
Negoos of Shoa in this manner brings with him
some present, which, after having been registered
by an officer appointed for that purpose, is deposited
at the feet of the monarch. In return,
it is expected that some request on the part of the
inferior is to be graciously acceded to, and if
what is asserted be true, the Negoos is obliged by
the law of custom to consent to whatever is asked,
should he accept, in the first instance, the proffered
gift. A monstrous exaggeration of this system of
presenting gifts, to be returned by some greater
amount of property, is, at all events, practised very
considerably, by the Abyssinians, upon ignorant
strangers, for the custom is not confined to an
interchange of favours with royalty, but is general
also among all classes. I have myself frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
been imposed upon, or at least have had attempts
made to impose upon me in this manner, when
ridiculously small presents were offered, and then
on my acceptance followed some exorbitant request.
A memolagee of eggs, for example, would
usher in a modest demand for as many dollars;
when, from a calculation I have frequently made,
one of the latter would purchase one thousand
eggs, at the rate of five eggs for a needle, of
which two hundred could be bought for a dollar.
Again, a jar of ale, containing about five gallons,
which would cost the third of an ahmulah, or salt-piece,
or the third of two-pence halfpenny, would
be deemed quite a sufficient gift to ask in return a
slave girl, or a mule. To prevent all mistakes,
after I had discovered that I had given considerable
offence, in some cases, by refusing what had
been demanded, I made it a rule to know previously
to my accepting it, what was the object for
which the memolagee was offered, and even then it
was very seldom I would consent to give more
than the market value of the pumpkins, water
melons, and smuggled honey, which generally constituted
these propitiatory offerings.</p>

<p>The memolagee I had prepared for this visit to
the Negoos, at Ankobar, was about two pounds of
sugar which I had managed to manufacture from
cane growing in the neighbourhood of Aliu Amba.
I calculated upon the effect that such a present
would have upon the naturally sagacious mind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the gifted monarch of Shoa, and that the usefulness
of such an article, introduced as a manufactured
product of his own country, would strike him as
being of more importance than many richer presents,
the use and value of which he could not, from
the circumstances of his situation, have any idea of.</p>

<p>On my arrival in Shoa, I found that the Wallasmah
Mahomed cultivated sugar-cane in a valley,
at the foot of the prison hill of Guancho, and
that he supplied the table of the Negoos with it as
a sweetmeat, small pieces being cut off with a knife,
and masticated as I have seen the inhabitants of
Ceylon enjoying it. Whilst staying at Miriam’s
house, I conceived the project of boiling down some
sugar as a mode of employing myself when confined
indoors by the fever, or the wet weather. For this
purpose I sent Walderheros to the Wallasmah with
a canister of gunpowder as a memolagee for some
sugar-cane, and got in return as much as my
zealous servant could stand under, considering that
he had to carry the bundle upon his head and
shoulders for nearly six miles, along roads of no
ordinary kind in the wet season, for that rich,
greasy, slipperiness of surface, where toes well
stuck into the mud, alone admits of any chance of
the barefooted wayfarer, pulling himself up the
steep “banks and braes” he has to surmount.</p>

<p>Possessing no means of crushing the cane properly,
I was obliged to have resort to simply pounding
it in a large wooden mortar, two or three of which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
of different sizes, are generally to be found in every
house in Shoa. Miriam, her son, Walderheros, and
myself occupied ourselves one day peeling and
slicing the long stalks before we could place the
cut-up cane in the mortar, and then we were employed
two days more in triturating it, during which
process a little water was added to take up the
saccharine juice, and to free it, according to my
idea, more readily from the cane. Two handsful of
the beaten mass were then placed at a time, in one
of my towels, which being folded up, the two extremities
were collected together, and by dint of a
great deal of twisting and screwing by two of us,
we managed to force out the liquid portion, leaving
a hard round ball of woody fibrous substance,
which, however, had been pounded sufficiently
fine to receive and retain, very visibly, the diaper
pattern of the cloth in which it was strained.
These refuse cakes were very greedily eaten by some
goats, and I dare say, such food would be highly
nutritious to animals. The expressed juice having
been received into my copper cooking vessels,
they were placed uncovered upon a low fire,
where they continued until more than one-half of
the liquid portion was driven off. The remainder
was then poured into some shallow earthenware
dishes, which, with stones carefully placed under the
lower edges of the vessels, to obviate the inconvenient
slope, were exposed upon the conical roof of
the house, to the evaporating influence of the temporary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
and dodging glimpses of sunshine, that
struggled through the vast number of clouds, which
at this season of the year obscured the sky.</p>

<p>How well I recollect my querulous anxiety, and
the patient watchfulness of Walderheros, as all day
long we were obliged to be on the expectant quick
move, to bring out of the passing showers these
evaporating dishes, and which, at length, we were
obliged to submit to the continued action of a slow
fire indoors to effect our object, for we discovered,
that what between the moisture in the air, and the
frequent falls of rain the season was not at all propitious
for sugar making. In the end we succeeded
in obtaining about two pounds of very excellent
brown sugar, as the result of our joint labours,
and very well pleased all parties were with their
success.</p>

<p>It was curious to observe the interest that was
taken in the process by the inhabitants of Aliu
Amba, nearly all of whom visited me during the
three or four days we were employed, and not a
few insisted upon helping us. Of these latter, Walderheros
was especially jealous, as he wished all
the honour and glory as the actual manufacturer to
devolve upon himself, giving me only the credit of
knowing how it should be done, and of directing
him. When the sugar had crystallized and
assumed the shape of the much-desired luxury, a
new class of visitors then came begging for a little
as a medicine for their sick children, and these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
became so numerous, and I could not well refuse
their request, that at last Walderheros, in despair,
complained to Tinta, who had all along been
much interested in the success of the experiment,
and who immediately came, and advised me to put
the sugar into his charge, if I wished to save any
for the Negoos.</p>

<p>Here I must observe, that although the very
simple art of extracting the sugar from the cane
was unknown to the inhabitants generally of Shoa,
still a few visitors from Ankobar, and a messenger
from the Negoos, who had been sent to Aliu Amba
on purpose to learn if the rumour was true which
had reached the palace, that I was engaged in this
manufacture, had seen Shoan sugar before. These
assured me that the French traveller, M. Rochet
d’Hericourt, when he was in Shoa, had made sugar
for the Negoos, so that although I observed on this
occasion great ignorance of a simple but important
art among the Shoans, still I do not wish to be
understood as claiming the honour of having first
introduced sugar-making into their country.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for me that I had thus turned
my attention to subjects likely to benefit the good
people of Shoa, for as it so happened, in the middle
of the night, I was attacked with a paroxysm of
fever so violent that it quite disabled me for the
rest of the next day, and prevented me making any
attempt to proceed to Ankobar. As, however, I
had sent word by the messenger of the Negoos
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
that I was coming, and my balderabah Tinta had
arranged everything for our starting together by
sunrise, I considered that it would be as well to
send my servant with the sugar, and a verbal message
to the Negoos, stating why I could not attend
myself in person. Tinta also considered, that circumstanced
as I was, it would be the best plan for
me to adopt, and readily agreed to accompany Walderheros,
and explain my wishes respecting the
house. After a little conversation, we also fixed
upon the one most likely to suit me, and they then
departed with the sugar, which I had packed up
for them in an old tin powder-canister.</p>

<p>They returned early in the afternoon attended
by a long train of Tinta’s servants, and three palace
affaroitsh, bearing presents of wheaten bread,
honey, and a jar of preserved butter called “natta
kibbee,” the only kind that can be obtained in
Shoa during the times of the rains.</p>

<p>The reception of my balderabah and envoy,
Walderheros, at the palace had been most nattering,
and my request for a house complied with immediately
by the gratified monarch, who also ordered
one of the affaroitsh to remain in Aliu Amba to
see me comfortably settled in my new quarters.</p>

<p>The next morning was a very busy one for
Walderheros, as from my illness everything had
devolved upon him. He had first to arrange with
two surviving sisters of the late owner of the
house, who came forward to claim sundry articles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
of furniture that had remained in the house after
the death of their brother. In Shoa, when a
man dies, leaving no male heirs, the King takes
all that he died possessed of; even the widow
and female children have no claim to anything
but that which is granted to them by the justice
and compassion of the monarch. These relations
are, however, so far considered, that a small
“memolagee” only is expected, and they are then
generally allowed to retain the personal property
of the deceased, but the landed estate is always
retained and granted to some other male servitor
capable of bearing arms. This concession, small
as it is, does not extend to other ties of kindred,
for a person dying and leaving only sisters or
brothers, all kinds of property possessed by the
deceased is seized by the governor of the town in
which he had resided, for the benefit of the Negoos,
and an account of all such intestate property is
annually drawn up by that officer. When a
governor himself dies, before his successor takes
office, an inventory of every thing contained in a
large store house is made, and sometimes all the
articles, generally household furniture, are taken
to be examined by the Negoos, who, retaining the
most valuable himself, returns the remainder to
the charge of the new governor. From these
repositories are rewarded minor meritorious acts,
and sometimes the things are exposed to sale by
a kind of auction, and thus disposed of. It is not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
unusual for household furniture and utensils,
instead of being carried to the <i>gimjon bait</i>, the
King’s store house, the only public building
found in the towns and villages of Shoa, to be
allowed to remain in the house to which they
have belonged, and in that case, the next holder
upon whom the King has conferred it, comes in for
these conveniences. It was so in my case, for
I found that I had not only obtained possession
of a house, but found it ready furnished also.
One little drawback from my apparent good
fortune was the circumstance that everything was
in such a dilapidated and rotten condition, that I
was not surprised at the governor not insisting
upon such rubbish being taken to that general
repository, the “gimjon bait.” The fact is, the
good people of Shoa manage, as in every other
country, to remedy by some conventional subterfuge
any political or social injustice; and here,
where the descent of property is diverted from its
natural course by an arbitrary custom, the evil is
counteracted by the exchange, during illness, of
everything valuable in furniture or household
utensils with near relations, for the most worthless
description of the same articles, so that in case of
death the Negoos gets a very sorry collection as
the heir-at-law to the deceased.</p>

<p>No sooner did Tinta proceed to the house to put
Walderheros in possession, than the two women,
sisters of the late possessor, came forward, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
improving upon the general system, of making the
exchange of old worn out things for nearly new
ones, they now appealed to a cloud of witnesses,
who took part with them, to testify that many of
the jars, baking pans, and instruments for clearing
and spinning cotton that were in the house,
absolutely belonged to them, and which at various
times they had lent to their deceased brother.
Tinta, to prove his devotion to me, for being now
considered to be in great favour with the Negoos,
my friendship was valuable, demurred to the claims
of the women; but Walderheros, who knew me a
little better, put an end to their vociferous claims,
and recommending them to see me upon the
subject, said it would probably be all settled
satisfactorily without a complaint being made to
the Negoos, which had been threatened by Tinta.</p>

<p>The market value of every thing that formed
their claim did not amount to half a dollar, but as
the matter seemed to interest all the inhabitants of
the town, it must have been considered of some
importance in their eyes, so when they came to
appeal to me, and I fully understood, by the
interpretation of some Arabs resident in Aliu
Amba, what it was that was required, I told the
two women they had my consent to take away
whatever they chose, only to be quick about it, so
that on the morrow I might enter upon my new
possession without any more trouble.</p>

<p><i>July 23d.</i>—This morning, my house having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
been well swept and dusted, I was summoned by
Walderheros to come and superintend all other
arrangements myself. I managed to walk down
from Miriam’s, and a new large alga, or bedstead,
had been sent from the King’s store for my use.
It was placed for the present in the garden, an ox
skin, as usual, being spread over it, so I had nothing
to do but to throw myself upon it, and as my boxes
and cooking utensils were brought in, direct Walderheros
where to place them. Fortunately, no rain
fell this day, and my new neighbours, anxious to
testify their happiness to have me among them,
kept thronging into the garden, amusing themselves
also by surveying the premises, suggesting repairs
and improvements with the most officious good
feeling possible. As all the inhabitants around
were Mahomedans, several of my visitors sent to
their houses for their gourd shell water pipes, and
placing large stones beneath them, took up their
several positions in a semicircle around the front of
my bed. Miriam, to whom I had given three
dollars, pleasingly surprised at receiving so much,
seemed most anxious that I should be comfortably
settled in my new residence, her son helping
Walderheros in arranging everything properly,
whilst she busied herself preparing coffee for my
numerous visitors.</p>

<p>I was tired and worn out by the time sunset sent
them to their several homes, and left me to move
into the house, where I sat upon one of my boxes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
until the alga had been forced into a narrow recess
between the double walls, and my bed reported by
the indefatigable Walderheros to be at length ready
for me to retire to rest. The pretty wife of Sheik
Tigh had brought me some teff bread for supper, as
she expected there would be a deal too much for us
to do on the first day of my removal, not to feel
obliged to any one taking the trouble of baking off
our hands. The “wort,” or cayenne soup being also
prepared, after a light Abyssinian supper, I slept
better than I expected, or could have hoped for.</p>

</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Abyssinians divide the day and night into
eight portions of three hours each, and as they
commence their fasts the evening preceding, it is to
be presumed that they begin a new day at sunset,
like the Jews and Arabs. Three hours after sunset
is <i>leilet</i>, “evening,” all the time intervening
between nine o’clock and twelve being so called.
From “night’s noon,” or <i>aculilielet</i>, until <i>duro-oitshiart</i>,
“cockcrow,” is another term of three hours,
and from cockcrow to <i>twart</i>, “sunrise,” is three
more; after twart is <i>arrafat</i>, or “nine o’clock;”
then <i>aculican</i>, “mid-day,” between which and sunset
is <i>tuzziart</i>, or “afternoon.”</p>

<p>During the first night after taking possession of my
new house, about the hour of “duro-oitshiart,” (here
let the reader learn a little Amharic), I was awakened,
by a loud thunder-storm, to the disagreeable discovery
that my new residence was not water-proof, for the
roof admitted a great deal more rain than it threw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
off, and had not Walderheros constructed a kind of
pent-house over my bed with a stiffly-dried ox-hide,
I should have been very soon wet through. The
necessity, too, of having some kind of candle or other
on emergencies, was forcibly suggested to us, by the
difficulty we experienced in getting the damp fire-wood
lighted, by the blaze of which alone we could
see to arrange our substitutes for umbrellas. Walderheros,
however, soon overcame all difficulties,
and after extending his bed, the aforesaid skin,
over me for my protection, he coiled himself up
under a huge Amharic shield, tilted upon its edge,
and supported by a stick in that position.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say we did not go to sleep
again, but kept talking away about what we would
do to the roof, as soon as the sun had risen, and we
could only get out. Accordingly by twart (sunrise),
Walderheros had started on a long walk nearly to
Ankobar to get some straw, and also to engage
a “wandum,” that is, a near relation of his
whom I had determined, at his request, to receive
as an additional servant. His wages were to be
only five ahmulahs a-month, about one shilling
and a half-penny, and as he was stated to be the
very first of all modern thatchers, I did not consider
this an extravagant demand, particularly as I
required his services so much at this time.</p>

<p>“Wandum” is, strictly speaking, brother, but
with the Shoans it is used as a general term for all
male relatives. An uncle is the “wandum,” of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
mother or father, as the case may be, whilst
cousins, especially between opposite sexes, appear to
be more affectionately related than our brothers or
sisters. A friend is called “wordage,” a name
derived from some relation between them and one’s
own bowels, “word,” signifying that viscera, which
reminded me of a scriptural passage, where,
describing the affection of some one for another, it
is said that “his bowels yearned towards him.”
“Bal-ingero,” is another expressive term for a
companion, signifying “the possessor or sharer of
bread.” And as I am on the subject, I may
mention, that an additional term of friendly
relationship among this very social people, is
derived from the circumstance of the marriage tie
in this country, being but very loosely observed.
“Leech enart,” mother’s child, is sometimes bestowed
upon a very dear friend, as being expressive
of a great deal more affection than “Leech abat,”
father’s child.</p>

<p>By “arrafat,” nine o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, Walderheros,
and his wandum, Goodaloo, appeared at the rude
misshapen wicket in the small ring fence of
jowarree stalks, that enclosed my garden. Both
were bending beneath huge bundles of the straw-like
cimbyllal grass, but being too large to admit
of passing through the narrow entrance, they were
thrown down in the little lane that led from my
house, and from a few other neighbouring ones,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
into the principal street on our side of the town,
to the market-place.</p>

<p>Goodaloo, was spare, short, and active, seemingly
designed by nature for the ticklish occupation he
professed; for the frail stick skeleton roof, when
divested of the old straw, looked as if it would
have given way beneath the foot of a cat. After
a professional survey, and a most important consultation
with Tinta, his deputy, a Christian like
himself, and half-a-dozen rich Islam inhabitants,
it was determined to be most advisable, that only
a portion of the roof should be renewed at once, so
that I might have the shelter, either of the old or
of the newly finished roof, to sleep under, during
the three days required to put all to rights. The
Governor and his Deputy, however, were the only
useful members of this Council, for the former
directed his servants to supply me with the
necessary grass, whilst the latter assisted Goodaloo
in thatching. The Islam gentlemen, with the cool
dignity which, somehow or other, they do assume
most naturally, sat down upon the skins brought
for that purpose, and proceeded to call for coffee,
and to give directions to their Christian superiors,
in a manner that would have delighted Satan
himself, to have observed, if he takes any pleasure
at all, in seeing honest, simple humility, treated
with the most evident contempt.</p>

<p>All this time, I was glad to keep out of the way,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
lying upon the alga inside; but when actual
business commenced, I began to think I must
retreat into the open air. Black, sooty flakes, now
began to fall thickly from the glistening well-smoked
roof frame, which consisted of long bamboo
canes, that diverging from an elevated centre
spread around in a wide circumference, to rest upon
a round wattled wall of sticks and mud. To this
annoyance, was soon added falling bits of rotten
thatch, that descended upon my bare head and
shoulders, until I could stand it no longer, but
rushed out of the dirty mess and seated myself
upon a quantity of clean straw near to my Mahomedan
visitors, who appeared to have made my
garden a public café, for they kept coming and
going all day, staying a little to watch if the proceedings
were going on to their satisfaction, and
aiding, to the extent of an “Inshallah” (please
God), “it would be finished by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Before evening, one-third of the roof was well
covered in, for as I had promised to give a couple
of sheep at the conclusion of the business, to the
servants of Tinta, they worked away at his cimbyllal
grass, as if it had been all my own; and had
I not inwardly resolved to return his kindness in
some way or other, my conscience would have often
induced me to call out, “Hold! enough!”</p>

<p><i>July 30th.</i>—By cock-crow again Tinta’s servants
were at my gate with straw, and Walderheros and
Goodaloo went out to recommence upon the roof.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
We continued to be highly favoured by the weather,
only a slight shower or two interrupting the otherwise
bright sunshine in which I lay basking on my
straw couch all day. A thick mist enveloped the
whole length of the Ankobar range in front, which
seemed to attract all the clouds, or at least condensed
the moisture in the atmosphere to the west
of Aliu Amba, leaving the more favoured country
to the east beneath a clear and beautiful sky. The
heavy bank of fog, however, prognosticated rain to us,
and every time it caught the eye of Walderheros, he
seemed to move as quickly again, as he supplied with
fast filled arms the bundles of cimbyllal to the two
workmen upon the roof. So expeditiously, indeed,
did all proceed, that before sunset the whole was
finished, although, for farther security and ornament,
another day’s labour was required, which was promised
with much self-gratulation by Goodaloo, who
confidently asserted that had the house been thatched
for the Negoos himself, it could not have been done
more quickly or more scientifically.</p>

<p>It being too late, and the men too tired to kill
and dress sheep, Tinta’s servants partook, as last
evening, of a plain repast with Goodaloo and Walderheros,
consisting only of dry teff pancakes, and
a sop or two in a shallow earthenware vessel of
the cayenne soup. To improve this very poor
dinner, I gave Walderheros an ahmulah to get
some “tallah,” and he bought for that sum about
fifteen gallons of excellent ale. This he and two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
of his companions brought into the house in three
large jars, a girl following with the ahmulah,
which, I expect, she had changed for one of her
mother’s smallest, and after spanning the salt-piece
before my face, with a very lackadaisical look, intimated
that it was a very thin one, and she hoped I
would give her a larger one instead. Walderheros,
who was just as cunning as any of his countrymen
or women either, always kept the ahmulahs he
received in exchange for dollars in two bags, one
containing the larger, the other the smaller ones.
With the former, sheep and tobacco were purchased,
as for these commodities none but the best
ahmulahs are taken, whilst the latter were generally
given in return for services performed by any of
the neighbours, and which I paid for, according to
Walderheros’s idea, far too liberally. In the
present case, on my telling the girl she should
choose for herself, down came the bag containing
the little ones, the trick of which I was not then
aware, and after a long search, none pleasing the
lady, she withdrew, keeping the one which had
been originally given to her.</p>

<p>One of the jars being now placed upon a low
chair that had come to me as a memolagee for
some medicine, a long mekanet, or girdle, from the
loins of one of the party was carefully wrapped
around the wide circular mouth of the jar, after
the dirty dry seal of cow-dung and clay had been
removed. Over the lip of the vessel, slowly strained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
through the cloth, flowed the now released liquor,
which was received into well-shaped drinking-horns
of a conical form, and about nine inches
deep. One, full of the sparkling beverage, was
handed to me, Walderheros, in the first place,
pouring a little into the hollow of his hand and
drinking it, as the tasters of food and of drink of
old are represented to have done previous to serving
their superiors. This little ceremonial, though its
origin is entirely forgotten by the Shoans, is never
omitted by them, and we here find a custom,
first established by a fearful policy, still retained as
a matter of form, and as a dutiful obeisance of
inferiors to their masters. The drinking party sat
together in the dark talking for some hours, industriously
replenishing the horns until two of the jars
were emptied of their contents, when, pretty comfortable,
no doubt, Walderheros and his friends
quietly subsided upon the ground, where they
had been sitting so long; their busy talk was
stayed at once, and all was soon as still as the
night should be.</p>

<p><i>July 31st.</i>—Long before sunrise I was again
disturbed by Tinta’s servants, who were up and
leaving my house to return home, so as not to be
absent at the first call of their master. This day
was to be devoted to the beautifying and adorning
the new roof after the most approved design.
The broken neck of an old jar was soon found,
which served as a kind of coronet to gather the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
loose ends of the thatch at the apex. Immediately
below this were thrust two sticks across each other,
their projecting extremities preventing a tight
band of very pliant twigs from starting, and which
beneath it had been twisted several times around
the loose ends, still farther to secure this part of
the roof, that, as the centre of the whole, was
something analogous to the key stone of an arch.</p>

<p>This being finished, the flat hands of Walderheros
and Goodaloo were applied to the irregular
projecting straw ends of the lower edge or circumference
of the roof, which were patted gently back
into one even line, with something like the
attention to detail of a careful barber arranging
the straggling hairs of a full-bottomed wig. The
circuit of the whole having been made, I was duly
called upon to inspect their work; but as I
supposed that it was not so much to give an
opinion as it was to express my approbation, I took
care sufficiently to gratify them, by stating it to be
my firm belief that no “Gypt” could have done it
half so well. To subdue unqualified approbation,
and that my praise should have the more importance,
as coming from a man of decidedly good
taste, I suggested that a brightly painted red
earthenware crown piece to the whole, like those
used to beautify their churches, would have looked
more religious, and better than the ragged rusty
looking neck of the broken jar, which, not having
been put on exactly square, but cocked a little on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
one side, gave a rather saucy slovenly finish to my
cottage ornée.</p>

<p>My indefatigable Islam friends now came to
congratulate me upon my roof being finished, and
began asking about the cow, with the blood of
which I was to sanctify the door-posts, as they said,
to keep “Shaitan” from disturbing me. They
contended that, to render the charm efficacious, the
animal must be killed by a Mahomedan. I shook
my head, and denied the necessity of this, or
indeed of the sacrifice at all; but I told them, as
they had helped me so much, they were very
welcome to partake of the two sheep Walderheros
had already gone to purchase. They said not a
word in reply, and many of them considered my
offer to be a gross insult, and stayed away several
days in consequence. However, as I had now
begun to speak a little Amharic, and did not
require their assistance so much as formerly to
interpret for me, I was ungrateful enough to allow
them to come round again in their own good time.</p>

<p>The evening was spent by Walderheros and his
friends killing the sheep; and having boiled the
meat in several earthenware vessels, demonstrated,
by a very hearty meal, that on ordinary occasions
the Shoans are as fond of cooked meat as the rest
of mankind.</p>

<p>The customary practice of eating it raw, so
singular, and apparently so characteristic of a
barbarous and savage disposition, has, in Abyssinia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
a natural inducement for its indulgence, which, I
think, is an apt illustration of the manner, in which
man is led instinctively, to the employment of such
means within his reach, to enable him fully to
enjoy life, under whatever circumstances of situation
he may be placed.</p>

<p>The difference of food between the inhabitants
of the Arctic region and those of low intertropical
countries is so great, that it has not failed to strike
physiologists, who have, from the comparison, been
led to the knowledge of an important truth in the
natural economy of man. It has been observed that
human life is supported in these opposite extremes of
situation by different kinds of food, and that whilst
in the north, blubber and enormous quantities of raw
meat are devoured by the natives, that in the
torrid zone, vegetables constitute the principal
diet. The reason is, that during the process of
digestion a considerable amount of natural heat is
engendered in the system, and this is found to be
determined in quantity by the nature of the food.
An entirely fleshy diet occasions the development of
its maximum, and contributes materially to the comfort
of man in cold situations, whilst, on the contrary,
vegetables are scarcely able to excite sufficient heat
necessary to convert them into nutriment; and, in
fact, beneficent nature has provided for such a want,
by supplying in hot climates a sort of artificial
warmth, in the stimulating aromatics which are the
characteristic productions of the torrid zone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
The high table land of Abyssinia, although
situated between the tropic of Cancer and the
equator, from its great elevation of ten thousand feet
or more above the level of the sea, possesses a climate
which is not less cold than that of the northern parts
of Scotland. Being a country but poorly wooded,
the chief supply of fuel being the dung of cattle,
an instinctive feeling dependent upon the pleasures
of a state of warmth, has taught the Abyssinians
that the flesh of animals eaten raw is a source of
great physical enjoyment, by the cordial and
warming effects upon the system produced by its
digestion, and to which I am convinced <i lang="fr">bon
vivants</i> more civilized than the Abyssinians would
resort if placed in their situation. Travellers who
have witnessed their “brunde” feasts can attest the
intoxicating effects of this kind of food, and they
must have been astonished at the immense quantities
that can be eaten in the raw state, compared
to that when the meat is cooked, and at the insensibility
which it sometimes produces. Eating raw
meat, therefore, a usual practice with the Esquimaux,
and which among them is an absolute
necessity, by the Abyssinians is considered a
luxury, or in fact as a kind of dissipation, for
eating it in that state is only indulged in by them
at festivals, and it is then taken as a means of
enjoyment, and is not more barbarous or disgusting
than getting tipsy upon strong drinks.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>July 29.</i>—The next Friday, feeling somewhat
stronger, I determined to accompany Walderheros
to the market-place. As in England, the days of
such weekly meetings, for the convenience of sale
or barter, vary in the towns of Shoa. In Aliu
Amba the Mahomedan Sabbath is found most convenient,
whilst Ankobar market is held on Saturdays,
and in other places Mondays or Tuesdays are
the appointed days. Nothing, I think, characterizes
a peaceful people, or a healthy social condition,
more than these weekly meetings for the
mutual convenience of buyers and sellers. The
security of property is so apparent, honest industry
and prudent economy so evident, that even in the
most unfavourable positions for the increase of
knowledge, and the advance of civilization, wherever
these evidences of a people’s foresight and
good disposition exist, I never despair, but that
when other more favourable opportunities are vouchsafed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the soil will not be found unfruitful of the
good seed that may be scattered upon it. This
struck me the more forcibly, from my previous
sojourn in Adal; for with what different feelings
did I witness the busy restlessness, and the not
inharmonious murmur, of the multitude of smiling
contented beings that were gathered in the market-place
to-day, from those I have experienced, when
startled by the sudden cry, the confused rush to
arms, and the silent squatting of my Dankalli
associates, either in the sullen muttering calahm
circle, or else, as with loud yells of defiance, they
formed the line of immediate fight; either of which
characterized the only public assemblies I ever
witnessed among them.</p>

<p>Putting on my Arab cloak I followed Walderheros,
who had been long engaged, previously to
our starting for market, selecting the kind of dollar
most in reputation among the Shoans. We proceeded
along a narrow winding lane, between high
hedges of the <i>kufah bait</i>, and senna shrubs, that
assisted in forming the enclosure belonging to each
little cottage, that stood upon the banks on either
hand; playing about the wickets of which children
without number attested the peace and plenty
enjoyed by the people of Shoa. Population is the
criterion of human happiness; wherever is real
enjoyment of life, the offspring of man will always
be most abundant.</p>

<p>A very short descent led us to an equally winding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
road, but broader, and having more of the
character of a public way, than the little lane
from my house. Here we met market people
hawking their wares, with loud cries; or loud-talking
disputants, carrying on a strong argument,
as they battered away, with heavy but harmless
blows of their long sticks, upon the goat skin sacks
of grain or cotton, with which numerous donkeys
before them were laden, and which were being
conveyed to the market-place.</p>

<p>The low hum of distant voices gradually increased
into a murmur, and then into a hubbub, as
we entered the market-place, which was a large
plain, occupying the southern half of the table
rock, bare and stony, except in the centre, where
a high circular hedge of a thin pipe-formed
euphorbia fenced in the Mahomedan burial place
of the town. Its limits, besides, were well defined
by a low stone wall, carried all around, and upon
that portion of it facing the entrance of our road
into the market place, sat Tinta, wrapt up in the
customary manner in his tobe, save his head and
one arm, with which he gave directions respecting
the receiving of toll, or deciding such cases of
dispute as might arise in the course of the
market. As soon as he saw me with Walderheros,
he called me to him, and as I approached, he shifted
his position so that I might sit upon the sun dried
ox skin by his side. A favoured visitor, honoured
thus by a seat upon the bench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
I observed that everything that is exposed for
sale in the market pays a kind of duty. This is
generally either in kind, or an equivalent in salt
pieces, the only money in Shoa. Grain is examined
by the Governor, to whom it is brought,
who determines the amount to be taken as toll,
and which is regulated according to certain customary
laws. Such toll is measured by single
handsful, a species of measure very usual in Shoa,
and called “tring.” Butter is submitted to a
similar process, the officer appointed scooping out
of the gourd-shell, in which it is generally brought,
a quantity with his fingers, which is then put into
a recipient jar that stands by his side. The salt
merchants, cattle sellers, and, in fact, all dealers,
pay for the convenience of bartering their goods,
and during the day large heaps of ahmulahs, and of
market produce, accumulate around the feet of the
Governor, whose perquisites of office they appear
to be. A less profitable employment for him is
the settlement of disputes, as very long-winded
debates sometimes occur, before a settlement can
be established between the disputing parties; and
for this business no fees are demanded, although I
have no doubt, such a situation of general referee
in matters of the kind, is very productive of private
gifts.</p>

<p>People in the habit of attending the market
compromise their tolls, by a regular payment of
from one to three ahmulahs weekly, and they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
then allowed to bring whatever produce they
choose. I also understood that the people of the
town were exempted from any imposition of toll
for such articles they exposed for sale.</p>

<p>After amusing myself for some time, watching
the proceedings at this place for the “receipt of
custom,” and had witnessed a decision in this
counterpart of the ancient Piepoudre courts of
feudal times, I left Tinta for a while to stroll about
the market.</p>

<p>Excepting the dress and appearance of the
people, the articles exposed for sale, and the language
in which the transactions were carried on,
the Abyssinian market, in its more prominent
character, exactly resembles similar assemblages of
people in English towns; the same confused hum
of voices, busy ever changing figures crossing and
recrossing, stooping to look at wares, or pushing
through the crowd to make way to the seats of
those selling that which they may require. All is
bustle and apparent confusion, over which loud
cries of hawking sales-people reach to the very
outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>I pushed along with the rest, followed closely by
Walderheros, carrying the goat skin bag over his
shoulder, in which to carry home the ahmulahs we
were in search of, in exchange for our dollar. For
a moment as we passed, groups would suspend
their conversation to turn and look at the novel
figure that had intruded among them, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
strangers, to whom the white man was a curiosity,
would inquisitively ask from the townspeople all
particulars of my nation, and my business in Shoa.
No impertinent interruption, or shouting in derision,
made my visits to this busy scene unpleasant;
a short whisper, that I was a <i>balla durgo</i>,
and a friend of the Negoos, was sufficient to
restrain the most curious from pressing around,
even when, on pretence of directing me in choosing
the ahmulahs, which was an opportunity that the
more careful frequently sought, to introduce themselves
to my notice, and which was generally, in
such cases, the preliminary to some request for
medicine.</p>

<p>The object Walderheros and I had now in view
was to change the dollar, and for this purpose we
sought out that portion of the plain, where in
several orderly lines, numerous salt brokers sat
behind heaps of “ahmulahoitsh,” the remarkable
currency of Shoa, in common with all parts of
Abyssinia.</p>

<p>These ahmulahs, as they may be called, are thin
bricks of salt, which have been not inaptly compared
in size and shape to a mower’s whet-stone;
they vary some little in size, but few of them are
less than eight inches long. Their form is rather
interesting, from the fact of their being cut somewhat
in the ancient form of money pieces, thinner
at the two extremities than in the middle, and if
of metal might not have been inaptly termed a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
spit. The breadth across the centre of the
ahmulah is a little over two inches, whilst at the
extremities it scarcely measures one inch. The
height or thickness is uniform, being usually about
one inch and a quarter. As may naturally be
supposed, this money, consisting of a material so
soft and deliquescent as common salt, becomes
denuded by use, and that a great difference consequently
exists between the weight of a new
specimen, and one that has been in exchange for
only a few months. During the rainy season,
especially, in Abyssinia the waste of the ahmulahs
is very great, although the inhabitants, by burying
them in the wood ashes of their large hearths, or
suspending them in the smoke from the roof, endeavour
to preserve them, at that time, from the
action of the moisture in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens, also, that carelessness
exposes them sometimes to the chances of a
quick reduction in size, by leaving the ahmulahs in
situations where mules or cattle can get to them;
and as all domestic animals are inmates of the same
apartment with the family during the night, these
opportunities of robbing their master by licking the
salt-pieces, is frequently a temptation too great for
their virtue. It is amusing, also, sometimes to witness
in the market-place the contests between children
who have been entrusted with an ahmulah, and the
flocks of goat and sheep with which they are immediately
beset. These circumstances are mentioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
because they have considerable effect upon the value
of this sort of money, ahmulahs much worn not
being received as such at all, and can only be weighed
against weight in the ordinary mode of barter, in
which case, I presume, they lose their character as
currency, and must be considered articles of
exchange alone.</p>

<p>As money, new salt-pieces are given during the
dry months in the town of Aliu Amba, at the rate of
twenty for the most favoured Austrian dollar. This
is of the mintage of the Empress, Maria Theresa,
and is called “<i>sait burr</i>,” woman silver; and it
is particularly insisted upon, that to be genuine,
these should possess certain peculiarities, namely,
that the bust of the Empress should bear a tiara or
bandeau placed in the hair, a star of many points
upon the shoulder, and beneath all, near to the
rim, the letters F. S. It is of great importance to
travellers in Abyssinia, at least in Shoa, to be aware
of the predilection of the natives for this kind of
dollar, which will always bring in exchange twenty-five
per cent. more than those of the mintage of the
Emperor, called “want burr,” man silver, and even
ten per cent. more than the Maria Theresa dollars,
which do not present these three important requisites.
In the wet months of August, September,
October, and November, from sixteen to eighteen
ahmulahs only can be obtained for the best dollars,
and for the others less in proportion. During this
time, it is with great difficulty that the “want burr,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
or Emperor’s dollar is taken at all by the Shoans.
I considered that twopence halfpenny was above
the actual value of an ahmulah in English money.</p>

<p>The salt-brokers are generally Christians, who
proceed in little kafilahs of fifty or sixty donkeys to
the northern confines of the kingdom of Shoa, to a
town called Giddem, where they meet with Mahomedan
merchants, subjects of Berroo Lobo, the
chief of the Argobbah, or valley country, to the
north of Efat. These latter obtain the ahmulahs
that they bring to Giddem from the salt-plain of
Ahoo, situated on the confines of the old kingdom of
Dankalli, to the south-east of the kingdom of Tigre.
At Giddem the best dollars are exchanged for
twenty-eight or thirty ahmulahs; so that a profit of
nearly fifty per cent. repays the expense and trouble
of carriage for little more than a distance of forty
miles to Aliu Amba. A like increase in value is
attendant upon farther carriage: thus sixteen
ahmulahs can only be got in exchange for the best
dollar in Angolahlah, which is about thirty miles
from Aliu Amba.</p>

<p>No people are more troublesome than the Abyssinians
in inspecting the money, whether salt-pieces
or dollars, that pass through their hands; the
former are turned over, spanned, balanced doubtingly
in the hand for several minutes before the final
determination is taken. The worst is, that the
vendors generally insist upon choosing, or at least
beg to be permitted to do so as a great favour, out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
of the whole lot, that may happen to be in the
possession of the party from whom they are
receiving them; the time so occupied being sometimes
provokingly long. At length the single ahmulah
is fixed upon, a last hurried look over the remaining
pile as they lie displayed upon the floor is taken,
then a glance at the chosen one in the hand, and
with such an effort, as if the party felt convinced that
he had taken the least; he at last reluctantly tears
himself away from the fascinating examination of
their relative value.</p>

<p>Dollars, again, are first well scrubbed with the
fingers, then spit upon, followed by a good rub
in the hair, and very probably, after all, the coin is
handed back with a sagacious shake of the head,
as much as to say, “I am not going to be done in that
way,” but seldom a word passes between the parties.
A salt banker at length being found who is content
to take the chance of the dollar being a counterfeit,
a good deal of higgling then takes place
whether nineteen or twenty ahmulahs shall be
given, but supposing the dollar is declared to be of
the first order, the broker in that case generally
gives way, and the full value is obtained.</p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens, either from carelessness
or atmospherical causes, that the ahmulahs
become very cellular and light. In that case the
holes are stopped up with a paste of meal and fine
salt dust, but the ahmulah so adulterated is generally
rejected at once when offered, or a very considerable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
reduction is made in its value when any
article is purchased.</p>

<p>When by any accident the salt-pieces are broken,
they are receivable only as common salt, although
sometimes, if but into two pieces, these are bound
round with a piece of very pliant tough bark called
“<i>lit</i>,” and at a diminished value still circulate.</p>

<p>Besides ahmulahs the Shoan markets are supplied
with a rough broken salt in thin broad pieces, of
no use but for culinary purposes, by the Dankalli,
who bring it to Dinnomalee from the Bahr Assal,
or salt lake, near Tajourah. This kind of salt is
of less value than the ahmulah, and is only
employed as barter, and the solid money-piece will
command weight for weight, one half as much more
of the Adal salt; so that the Shoans submit to a
loss of just fifty per cent. of material for the
convenience of their clumsy currency.</p>

<p>The town of Aliu Amba being occupied by
Christians and Mahomedans, its market presents a
much more varied appearance than either that of
Farree or Ankobar; the former being almost
exclusively frequented by Mahomedans, whilst the
latter (which is held in the meadow adjoining to
the mill of Demetrius, on the road to Tchakkah) is
as exclusively Christian in its dealings. To judge
from the character of the produce sent to Aliu
Amba market, it would not be difficult to assign the
greater amount of wealth in Shoa to the possession
of the Christian subjects of Sahale Selassee; but, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
the other hand, it appears to be a principle of
religion almost, among the Mahomedans, to conceal
the riches they possess, so that appearances are not
to be trusted. Had I not known that the more
wealthy of their religion invariably invest their
money in slaves, to supply the Dankalli and Hurrah
dealers, I should certainly have inferred from the
scanty and very limited stores placed before the
saleswomen of that faith in Aliu Amba market,
that the Islam inhabitants of Shoa were exceedingly
poor. Many of these women sit for a whole
day, offering, in exchange for anything in the shape
of corn that may be offered, a thimbleful of “col,”
(antimony used for blackening the edges of the
eyelids,) a few lumps of gum myrrh, a handful of
frankincense, or a little shumlah, the blue and
red threads of unwoven cloth, brought from the
sea-coast, and which is used in forming the ornamental
borders of their large body cloths. Sometimes
their scanty stock is increased by three or
four lemons, or as many needles. On the contrary,
the Amhara (the name now given only to
Christians of this country) bring an abundance of
cotton cloths, of cattle, of corn, and are the only
money-changers I saw, some of them sitting behind
high walls of new and good-conditioned salt-pieces.</p>

<p>Trade, in a great measure, is carried on by barter,
an exchange of commodities being much more
general than purchasing with ahmulahs; except in
the case of cattle buying, when the price is generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
fixed at a certain number of these salt-pieces.
For two ahmulahs a very fine young sheep or
goat may be bought, and the very best of the kind
will not sell for more than five. A good-sized goat,
however, commands a much higher price, ten or
twelve ahmulahs being sometimes asked. An ox
for ploughing brings about seventy ahmulahs, or, if
small and intended for killing, may be bought as
low as thirty. Horses and mules vary in price
from seven to twelve dollars. The latter are preferred
by the Abyssinians. I have been offered a
very excellent horse for two dollars, and have seen
one blind, but in good condition, sold for twelve
ahmulahs, or about two shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p>The next principal thing in the market is the
cotton cloths, which are woven of one general
width, about three quarters of a yard, and from ten
to fifteen yards long. Of the common kind are
made the “sennafil,” or wide short trowsers of the
men, and the “shumah,” or waist-cloth, of the
women. The body-cloth, or tobe, is common to both
sexes, but those of the men being much larger than
those of the women, are generally double folds of
the cloth, or four cubits in breadth, and at least seven
cubits long. Sometimes they are of an extravagant
size. A narrow border of the blue and red woollen
stuff, called shumlah, woven into the cloth, is the
only ornament, and these coloured stripes will be
sometimes repeated at the distance of a foot from
each other through the whole length of the cloth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
These tobes vary in price according to the number
of these ornamental additions to the simple cotton
thread, of which the greater number are entirely
composed. Four or five dollars is a great price to
give for one, but the one forwarded to our Queen
by Sahale Selassee was worth thirty dollars. I
gave for a cloth for Walderheros, which was ten
yards long and three quarters broad, ten ahmulahs;
but when I wanted one a little finer, with a stripe
across each end of the blue and white worsted, for
my own use, I had to give a dollar for it.</p>

<p>The mekanet, or girdle, generally woven for the
purpose, is considered to be worth one ahmulah
for a cubit, or from the point of the elbow to the
extreme tip of the middle finger, which is the only
measure of cloth in Abyssinia. Neither hats nor
shoes are worn by the Amhara; but the Islam men
wear sandals, made something like the Dankalli
ones, and I think those which are brought into the
market are made by some settler in Aliu Amba,
either from Adal, or the city of Hurroo, and not by a
native Abyssinian. I bought myself a pair, having
worn out my English shoes, and gave the sum of
three ahmulahs (7½<i>d.</i>) for them, but Walderheros
bargained for a sword-belt besides from the man
who sold them to me.</p>

<p>Among the articles of food exposed for sale, are
great quantities of grain in small skin-bags holding
perhaps, four or five pecks, and which may be purchased
for as many ahmulahs. Barley is somewhat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
cheaper than wheat, but the price is not so much
less as I should have expected. Marshilla, or
dourah, is half as cheap again as wheat. It is used
principally as “<i>nuffrau</i>,” being boiled in water, and
with a little salt sprinkled upon it, eaten in that
state. This dish forms the principal food of the
slaves belonging to the slave-merchants on their
journey to the coast, but in Shoa the slaves in
Christian households, as I have before observed,
usually live in the same manner as their owners,
and are invariably considered as part of his family.</p>

<p>Peas, kidney-beans, and the common horse-beans
are also used in the same manner, and are generally
sold so low as two Islam cuna, or nearly two pecks,
for an ahmulah. Onions and the green leaves of a
species of kail are hawked about the town, broken
salt being exchanged, according to the quantity that
can be decided upon as the fair value, after a deal of
higgling between the two parties.</p>

<p>Tut, or cotton, and tobacco are sold for salt only,
according to weight, a rude kind of balance called
<i>mezan</i> being employed for this purpose. This is a kind
of steelyard, made of hide and wood; a piece of thick
cowskin is dried in the sun upon a round stone, till
it assumes the form and size of a small washhand-basin,
which is suspended by four thongs of skin to
the thin end of a stick, about fourteen inches long,
heavy and thick at the further extremity. Notches
are cut with a knife, not in any regular manner, for
about two inches from the scale end, on the under side.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
These notches receive the bite of a cotton thread
loop, and when suspended by this, its position in
any of the knots mark no established standard
weight, but merely that of the article to be exchanged;
of course such a weighing-machine can
only be employed in barter.</p>

<p>Honey and butter are not regularly brought to
the market as the supply is dependant in a great
measure upon the season, scarcely any during the
latter part of the dry, and the earlier part of the
wet season, being to be obtained but through the
favour of the Negoos, who forwards to his governors
or favoured guests large jars of these articles as
presents during the period of its scarcity. The
manner in which butter is preserved by the Abyssinians
is rather peculiar; and I must observe, that
strictly, all the honey produced in the country is
claimed by the Negoos, who, however, generally
gives some equivalent for it, so that I never heard
this <em>apparently</em> arbitrary circumstance complained
of; although I have frequently noticed the clandestine
manner in which small quantities of this delicacy
were obtained by the nominal owners, who
wished to have the opportunity of obtaining some
few ahmulahs by selling it to me. The kind that
was exposed in the market for sale, was the refuse
of the first droppings of the comb, or merely the
last drainings mixed with more than one-half of
fragmentary wax, and the dead bodies of bees. The
Abyssinians, to their credit, do not kill these interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
and industrious insects, but place in juxtaposition
to the hive, supposed to be nearly full of
honey, an empty one, and in a very short time, the
whole of the inhabitants of the older hive, have
commenced constructing fresh combs in the new
one placed for their convenience.</p>

<p>For one ahmulah a <i>winechar</i>, or drinking-hornful,
holding about a pint of honey, is obtained; and double
that quantity of butter brings the same price, so that
I consider both articles very dear. Immediately after
the rains, however, three or four times this quantity
of butter may be obtained for an ahmulah. Besides
cotton and tobacco, “<i>gaisho</i>,” or the dried leaves of
a shrub belonging to the same species of plant as
the tea-tree, is also sold by weight against salt;
these leaves are used as a bitter in brewing the
native beer instead of hops. Six times in weight
of this article is given in exchange for one of salt,
but if weighed against cotton, four times the quantity
of gaisho is given.</p>

<p>Tobacco in small round cakes, two inches in
diameter, and half an inch thick is also weighed
in exchange for salt, two of tobacco being considered
equal to one of salt; it is grown in the <i>wana-daggan</i>
country, or where the climate is temperate, in
contradistinction to <i>daggan</i>, or highlands, and
<i>kolla</i>, or lowlands. Tobacco is the article in
which the people of the wana-daggan chiefly
speculate, taking it down to the kolla country in
exchange for cotton, seven times its weight being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
then demanded. They also carry berberah, or the
red cayenne-pepper pods to the <i>daggan</i>, or cold
country, where they obtain wheat or other grain in
exchange, five times the weight of berberah being
given. The quantity of grain given for tobacco
depends greatly upon circumstances; the eye of the
seller, and the appetite of the purchaser of the
tobacco, determining the rate of exchange.</p>

<p>Besides these articles, all of which are exposed for
sale in the market-place of Aliu Amba, saddle-makers
from Ankobar, spear and sword manufacturers from
the Tabeeb, or artificers’ monasteries, supply it
with their wares, and the industrious inhabitants of
the latter also bring hoes and plough-irons, and
their women and children hawk about the town,
with loud cries, coarse earthenware utensils for
sale.</p>

<p>No Hebrew pedlar is to be seen in this, or any
other market-place, though a recent traveller of
Shoa has asserted such to be the case, and to allow
the assertion to pass without denying it at once,
might lead to some ethnological error among the
naturalists of the human race, who might be speculating
upon the origin and descent of the true
Abyssinian. Such was the ignorance of both the
Amhara and the Islam of these people, that scarcely
a stranger called upon me, but desired to know if
I were not a “Yahude” (Jew). I questioned them
in return upon the very subject, and none had even
met with one, except some of the travelled slave-dealers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
the two or three pilgrims Shoa could boast
of who had visited Mecca, and who always advanced,
as one evidence of the extensive journeys they had
made, that they had seen a Jew. The Falasha of
northern Abyssinia, speaking the Agow language,
cannot be pretended to be of Hebrew descent, and
the more we hear of this interesting people the
more assured we shall be, that although practising
somewhat similar customs, no connexion, more
recent than prior to the era of the Exodus, can be
traced between them and the Jews.</p>

<p>Having noticed everything that can interest the
reader in an account of an Abyssinian market, I
shall now return home. Walderheros slings over
his shoulder a broad chain of ahmulahs, connected
together by the pliant <i>lit</i> bark; ten of the salt-pieces
reposing upon his chest, and the other half-dollar’s
worth in a corresponding manner hang
upon his back. Having arranged his burden, the
change for one dollar, we proceed together, saluting
Tinta as we pass him, sitting in judgment upon a
case of dispute that has just arisen; with shoulders
bare, the noisy declaimant addressing him, gesticulates
with much energy; the etiquette of respectful
undress, (unrobed to the waist,) admitting of the
freest exercise of the upper limbs, and a corresponding
display of the most approved oratorical
action is the consequence.</p>

<p>The evening of the market-day in Aliu Amba,
closes with similar scenes of jollity to those which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
characterize the hebdomadal meetings of farmers
and their friends in our own agricultural towns; and
the expression “market fresh,” best expresses the
condition of the staggering Christians, and of the
singing groups of male and female Abyssinians
returning home, who have been closing the labours
of the day with sundry deep potations of beer.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> my visit to the market, I was confined to
my house for two or three days by illness, but
feeling a little better this morning (August 1st), I
brought out a small saw I was possessed of, and
began to amuse myself, in giving the last finish to
the roof, by removing the projecting ends of the
cane rafters, which made the low eaves look
very ragged. Whilst thus employed, Sheik Tigh,
who had been absent some days at a “<i>tescar</i>,” or
funeral feast of a frontier Islam Governor, called,
and after congratulating me upon having come into
some property at last, gave me the astounding
information that Tinta had been removed from the
government of the town, and a rich Hurrah
merchant, who had come as an Ambassador to
Sahale Selassee, from the Imaum of that city, was
now the Governor.</p>

<p>The day that I left Miriam’s house, I heard that
a Hurrahgee kafilah was coming into Shoa, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
learnt then, that Aliu Amba was the town
appointed for the people belonging to it, as
Channo was for the Adal kafilahs. I sent
Walderheros to Tinta’s house to get more information,
but he had already left the town and gone to
Angolahlah to see the Negoos; as I supposed, to
remonstrate. I did not tell Sheik Tigh I was very
sorry at the news he brought me, because, as he
was a Mahomedan, he seemed so to enjoy the
circumstance of having a governor of his own
religion, and my regret, as a Christian, I was afraid,
would only elate him the more. I did the good
man wrong by my unworthy suspicion, for he was
certainly one of the best-hearted men I ever met.
On asking him who the new governor was, and
what business he had come upon to Shoa, he told
me that his name was Abdoanarch, and the
Wizeer of Sheik Houssein, Imaum of Hurrah, and
that he had come to induce the Negoos to join in a
league with all the other monarchs of Southern
Abyssinia to prevent the ingress of Europeans into
that country. I was not well enough to ask many
questions, but felt glad, that the return of the Embassy
to the coast had been decided upon, previous to
the arrival of Abdoanarch from Hurrah, and that
consequently he could not boast of having effected
such a desideratum among the Mahomedans of Shoa.</p>

<p>The bestowal of the government of Aliu
Amba upon the Hurrah ambassador, was a proof
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
of very high regard; and as the language of that
celebrated but little known city is a dialect of the
Geez, similar to the Amharic, Abdoanarch was not
considered to be altogether a foreigner. Besides,
he was, as I have remarked, a Mahomedan, and as
three-fourths of the inhabitants of Aliu Amba
professed the same belief, his appointment caused
great satisfaction. With him, a large kafilah of
his countrymen had arrived, at least, two hundred,
so that they made a sensible addition to the population,
which, at most, did not exceed three thousand
people. Indeed, accommodations for them could
not be found, and they were obliged to erect a
number of straw huts, on the other side of the
cemetery in the market-place. This new village
consisted of about fifty houses, all of them, merely
thatched roofs, resting upon the ground, with a low
entrance, not three feet high, cut out in front.</p>

<p>Sheik Tigh sat with me nearly all day; the
singularly situated and nearly unknown city of
Hurrah affording an inexhaustible subject of conversation.
As, however, he had never visited it,
and I subsequently received more accurate information
respecting this interesting place from a native,
I shall not now attempt to describe it.</p>

<p><i>August 2.</i>—My house was situated on the western
face of the rock of Aliu Amba standing upon its
own little terrace, which was enclosed partially by a
thick-leaved hedge, and where this failed by a row
of the yellow-stalks of the high Indian corn plant.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
It overlooked and was overlooked by a number of
other houses similarly constructed, each built upon
its own garden platform, one above the other, like
a series of high steps, from half way down the steep
hill-side, to the summit of a bluff, cone-like eminence,
in which the northern extremity, of the otherwise
flat-topped hill of Aliu Amba terminated. On this
exalted point, the long thatched roof of the largest
house of the town was visible over a strong palisading
of splintered ted, and over which two tall
mimosas towered like giant sentinels. To go near
here was considered a crime, and to break through
the enclosure would have been a sacrilege. This of
course was royal property, the “gimjon bait,”
where was preserved until the annual account
was made by the Governor to the King, all the
fines, lapses by death, and duties, that had accumulated
during that time. Beneath this public
storehouse was a long terrace, divided into several
enclosures, in each of which stood a snug cottage;
and these again looking upon one below, the top of
which scarcely reached the level of the ground,
the upper ones were built upon. Here dwelt a most
respectable man, an Islam slave-merchant, who kept
a gratuitous school for boys, whom he instructed in
Arabic, that is to say, in reading and writing
passages of the Koran. Far beneath the level of
this my own house stood, and before it, and on
either hand, were several others whose gardens
all surrounded mine. The hill at this point, too,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
seemed to assume a more umbrageous aspect, for
high “<i>shuahlah</i>,” sycamore fig-trees, and mimosas,
sheltered beneath their foliage the unassuming
roofs of thatch, which less and less, diminishing
as they descended the slope of the hill-side,
seemed at a very short distance from my garden to
have dropped into the yawning valley that separated
Aliu Amba from the opposite height; which
still higher, differed in its more gently sloping
ascent, and its ridge being occupied by a village
inhabited exclusively by Christians. Over this
again could be seen still more elevated crests, and
beyond these others, until the eye reached the last,
the commanding height of Ankobar; which, extending
some ten or twelve miles north and south,
each extremity then curved towards the east in one
vast amphitheatre, that encircled, as in an embrace,
an extensive valley of little village-crowned hills
and sunny slopes of cultivated fields.</p>

<p>This afternoon, having another serious attack of
my fever fit, one of my first acquaintances in Aliu
Amba, Hadjji Abdullah, undertook to provide me
with a certain cure. He went away, and returned
after a short time with a large bundle of green
odoriferous herbs. Walderheros was directed to boil
these well in my tea-kettle, and having poured out
the decoction into an open-mouthed earthen vessel.
I was wrapt up in a large tobe, underneath the
folds of which the remedy was placed. In this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
manner I sat for about a quarter of an hour, until
a profuse perspiration resulted from this primitive
kind of vapour bath, which had certainly one
good effect, that of producing at night a long-continued
sleep.</p>

<p><i>August 3d.</i>—As I felt a good deal better this
morning, I took a walk as far as the market-place,
to see the houses of the new come Hurrahgee
people. A great many turned out for my inspection,
to gratify themselves by looking at me;
which party was most entertained, I or them, at
the mutual novelty of our appearance, I do not
know, but after exchanging salutations with an old
man belonging to them, I returned home with
Walderheros.</p>

<p>Finding that I was still laying myself under great
obligations to Miriam, who came for a few hours
every day to grind flour and bake bread, I determined
that Walderheros should send for his wife
to come and take up her abode with him as housekeeper.
Goodaloo was accordingly sent on this
errand, and before night they returned together.
As a kind of offering upon the occasion she
brought, hanging in her tobe upon her back, a
large pumpkin. She was a good-looking girl of
about seventeen or eighteen years of age, and had
been married to Walderheros for five years. Her
father was one of the King’s watchmen, holding a
farm for that service, which required his absence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
one week out of four, at whichever palace of
Ankobar or Angolahlah the King should be then
absent from.</p>

<p>She was very soon down upon her knees before
a broad circular pan of earthenware placed upon
three stones, which was being heated for baking-bread
over a glaring fire of sticks. Taking a short
horn, in which was contained the well-powdered
dust of the oily seed of the cotton plant, she
scattered a small portion over the surface of the
nearly flat dish, which was about a foot and a-half
in diameter. She then rubbed this well over the
whole with a rag. The leavened batter had been
made ready in the morning by Miriam, so Wallata
Gabriel, my new housekeeper, had only to take a
little out in a basin, and from this pour it upon
the heated dish, quickly spreading it into a thin
layer, and then placing over all a hollow shield-like
cover, also of earthenware, the edges of which,
where it rested upon the pan, being luted with wet
rags that stood by contained in another spare basin
of water.</p>

<p>Sticks, a bundle of which had been brought in
by Goodaloo, lay upon the floor of the house, and
with these a bright fire was kept flaring away for
about five minutes, when the cover being taken off
a nice-looking crumpet curled up its edge all
round, as if anxious to be taken off and eaten.
This was adroitly done by Wallata Gabriel placing
upon her lap as she knelt a neat straw mat, something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
larger than the baking-dish itself, made of a
band of grass folded around one end as a centre,
and stiched into that situation. Upon this was pulled,
by a quick jerk, the warm cellular-surfaced bread,
and then getting up, my new handmaiden presented
it to me as it lay on the mat, with a look that said
“Taste it yourself, and see if I cannot bake bread.”</p>

<p>In this manner she soon turned over six or eight
of these pan-cakes, and a fowl having been boiled
to-day for the sake of the broth, of which alone I
could partake, no other food was cooked for my three
servants, they so far observing the fast, and soon after
their meal they retired to rest; Walderheros and his
wife occupying an ox-skin upon the floor, Goodaloo
making his bed in the porch, which was formed by
the passage into the house leading through the outer
and inner wall, being closed in on either side by a
mud-plastered partition.</p>

<p><i>August 4th.</i>—I was glad to find Tinta come back
this morning, he having returned with a message,
that if I knew how to make gunpowder, the Negoos
wished me to manufacture some for him. On
inquiring, I found that my balderabah still continued
in the good graces of the Negoos, who, instead
of the town of Aliu Amba, which convenience
had required should be given to Abdoanarch,
had put Tinta into possession of a much more valuable
one called Ramsey, in sight from my garden.
He was instructed, however, to live as usual in
Aliu Amba, to communicate between the Negoos
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
and myself, and to keep, at the same time, a careful
watch upon the outgoings and incomings of the great
Abdoanarch himself.</p>

<p>I soon satisfied him about the gunpowder, and
the next day was appointed for taking the first
step in the process, by making some charcoal, for
I was led to suppose that the inferiority of the
coarse grey-looking sort of native manufacture was
owing to the badness of that article. Two of Tinta’s
servants were immediately despatched for wood of
the “ted” (<i lang="la">Juniperus oxycedrus</i>) tree, which I had
chosen as best calculated for charcoal. The ted tree
is a species of pine, and grows in the characteristic
form of that tree. The wood smells exactly like
cedar, and is extensively used for fuel in the royal
residences. It does not grow on the table land,
but only in the upper portions of the valleys of
Efat and corresponding situations, at an elevation
of between six and eight thousand feet above the
level of the sea.</p>

<p>A large euphorbia called kol-qual, sometimes
thirty feet high, with strong spreading arms,
bearing at their extremities a little red fig-like
fruit, was pointed out to me by the Shoans as the
tree supposed to produce the best charcoal. This
cannot be the tree that Bruce asserts yielded so
much milk-like juice upon striking it with his
scimitar, although I have heard it asserted that it
is. On making the experiment myself on several
of different ages, I never could produce more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
a mere exudation of a white fluid, which collected
in drops, and which I found upon inspissation
turned black, and formed a substance not unlike
Indian rubber. The most singular circumstance
respecting this tree is the four-sided character of
its branches, being as angular as if put together by
a carpenter. On examining the interior of a
decayed portion, I found a shell of hard wood not
more than three-fourths of an inch in thickness;
and the interior sometimes, from side to side,
several inches wide, hollow, but divided into
chambers by partitions, consisting of a substance
like the paper formed by wasps in constructing
their tree-suspended nests.</p>

<p>I was called in to a singular case to-day; for
in Aliu Amba, I must observe, my professional services
were in great request, and I had stated hours
of attendance daily at my house, from sunrise to
nine o’clock, during which time my door was
regularly thronged. I went to see my new patient
with Walderheros, and found a youth about sixteen
years old, afflicted with a rupture in the groin, but
the protruded intestine had been returned by the
boy’s father just previously to my going into the
house. The people I found there, wanted me to do
something to prevent the recurrence of the complaint,
but as I had no trusses with me, I only
recommended rest and future care against violent
exertion. Understanding that I could do nothing
more, it was determined among them to proceed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
with an operation customary in their country, and
which I was invited to witness. I accordingly sat down
whilst the boy was laid upon his back on the alga.
The father then took a red burning stick, Walderheros
and others holding the patient down, and restraining
him whilst the former placed the rude searing
instrument over the diseased part, blowing it with
great vigour all the time to keep it alight. In less
than a minute the painful operation was over; and
the boy, who had been previously reminded that he
was a man, bore it with great fortitude.</p>

<p>The Shoans assert, that after this application of the
actual cautery rupture does not again occur; and I
could readily conceive it probable, considering the
great contraction sometimes consequent upon burns,
that this effect produced over the parts affected in
hernia might, in such cases, counteract the relaxation
of muscular fibre which occasions this disease. At
all events, where so few practical preventives for a
most serious complaint are known, I have considered
this observation worth recording, and as a
medical man even recommend the operation.</p>

<p><i>August 5th.</i>—Three long bundles of splintered
ted, carried upon the head of as many slaves of the
Negoos, were brought to my house this morning.
Cutting and carrying wood is the principal occupation
in Shoa of the male slaves, as carrying water is of the
females; and the prophets, when they say of the
Jews carried into captivity, that “they will be
cutters of wood and drawers of water,” convey the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
allusion that both sexes will be oppressed alike, and
suffer equally the laborious hardships of a state of
slavery.</p>

<p>It rained too much to-day to be able to make any
charcoal; and as I required the pieces of wood
brought me to be cut into more convenient lengths,
Walderheros and Goodaloo occupied themselves
doing this within doors. Sheik Tigh having gone to
reside at Bulga for a month, had given up his office as
my teacher in Amharic, so I determined to look out
for a duptera, or Christian scribe, as I was anxious
not only to speak Amharic as quickly as possible,
but also to read the Geez character, and get some
knowledge of that very interesting but neglected
language.</p>

<p>To-day commences a long fast for fifteen days,
called “Felsat.” No meat is allowed to be eaten,
and the first food taken daily must be after three
o’clock in the afternoon. Walderheros grants me
an indulgence, as I am very ill and weak. It
seems children and sick people are not required
to fast. I never saw the members of any
Church less bigoted than the Christians of Shoa,
but I am given to understand that more to the
north much less toleration is exhibited towards
Mahomedans and individuals of other faiths. I
have often thought, civilized as I considered myself
to be, that had I been in the place of Sahale Selassee,
I should not have acted quite so fairly to my Mahomedan
subjects; and when we consider that they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
are far inferior in numbers to the Christians, in the
proportion of about three to one, a great deal more
credit is due.</p>

<p><i>August 6th.</i>—Being a very fine morning, I had
my alga brought into the garden, and superintended
Walderheros and Goodaloo making the pile
of wood for burning it into charcoal; covering it
with the stalks of the thorn apple-plant, which
alone seemed to flourish around my house to the
exclusion of every other kind of herb. Upon this
green kind of thatch a layer of earth was placed, and
all being completed, fire was applied below, and the
aperture through which it was introduced immediately
closed up; a vent, or chimney, through the
centre alone being left open.</p>

<p>Instead of any length of time being necessary, I
found my charcoal-heap blazing away as if air entered
at twenty places. Being my first attempt as a practical
burner, I somehow expected this, and therefore
carried off the failure as a thing intended, for Walderheros
began to think his learned master a bit of a
quack when he found that I was ignorant of the simple
native cure for hernia; and he would now have been
downright sure of it had he not supposed that all my
present proceedings, regarding the charcoal-burning,
was necessary to produce the excellent article
required to make gunpowder as it was manufactured
in my country. I therefore sat and
looked at the blazing pile, revolving in my mind
what could possibly have caused the failure, for I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
believed I had observed every particular, that I had
been taught was necessary to convert wood into
charcoal. Fortunately for my credit, just when I
concluded that I knew nothing about it, and had
best say so, and before the whole heap had been
consumed, a sudden shower of rain poured down;
this of course spoiled all my arrangements, and
among other things, to all appearance put out
the fire. Here was a case for condolence; and
Walderheros, thinking I must want something to
support me under the disappointment, when the
rain had ceased, which was not for some hours,
took a straw basket and went to examine the ruins.
One effect of the rain, it seems, had been to beat
down the dome of earth and moist stalks of the
thorn apple, when the support of the wood inside
had been lost by the combustion. This buried considerable
portions of unburnt extremities of the
pieces of ted, and as they continued smouldering
underneath the fallen cover, the result was that,
much to my surprise, Walderheros brought me
back the basket full of beautifully close-grained
shining black and very light pieces of charcoal.
As Walderheros thought it was all quite
natural and right, I made no other remark than
merely asking him “if the people in Shoa ever
made charcoal like that.”</p>

<p>Having succeeded so well in this, it encouraged
us to proceed, and I sent to Tinta to say, that on
the morrow he must supply me with hand-mills and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
mortars to grind down and pulverize the other ingredients,
sulphur and saltpetre, of which a large
quantity of each had been brought to my house
from Ankobar during the day.</p>

<p>Both sulphur and saltpetre abound in Shoa, the
former being obtained from the volcanic country
immediately to the west of the Hawash, near
Azbottee. From an extinct crater, nearly half a
mile from our halting-place at Lee Adu, I had
brought to me a piece of the purest sulphur, that
required no farther process of refinement than the
natural sublimation by which it had been deposited
in the fissures of the cone. The Adal Bedouins who
occupy that neighbourhood bring it to the Negoos
of Shoa as a kind of tribute, and sometimes a demand
is made upon them for a certain quantity, which is delivered
in a few days, so plentifully is it found, to the
Wallasmah Mahomed, who forwards it to the Negoos.</p>

<p>Saltpetre is found in many places, both on the
table-land of Shoa, and in the valley countries to
the south and east. It is principally brought from
Bulga, where the grey rubbly earth it forms is
ploughed over, and the disturbed soil containing
more than fifty per cent. of the salt is placed in
immense earthenware jars containing water, in
which, by frequent agitation, the saltpetre becomes
suspended. The liquor is then decanted, and in
large saucers allowed to evaporate, when the finest
needle-formed crystals of the salt are formed.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>August 7th.</i>—Being Sunday, Tinta did not come to
my house. I also staid within all day, and took
advantage of Walderheros having nothing to do, to
be cupped in the Abyssinian manner, during the
cold stage of the fever, and which I expected would
attack me in the afternoon. A constant dull pain
in the left side, just over the region of the spleen,
gave me considerable uneasiness, for although I
was aware that in ague this viscus is always
affected, still I could not divest myself of the idea
that in my case it must be organically diseased.
I proposed, therefore, that the incisions should be
made in that situation, but Walderheros would not
hear of such a thing. Abstracting blood, to be
beneficial, he asserted, must either be upon the
crown of the head or at the back of the neck, and
should he perform the operation anywhere else, and
after all I should die, that the Negoos would put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
him to death as my murderer. Seeing that I could
not induce him, and both his wife and Goodaloo
being of the same opinion as himself, I allowed
him to use his own discretion. During the consultation,
however, that was held upon the occasion,
Hadjji Abdullah came in, and it was decided among
them I should be cupped upon the top of the head.
The hair being accordingly shaved off the assigned
place, in a circle about the size of a crown-piece,
the hollow upper end of a horn, about four inches
in length was then placed upon the bare skin. To
the tapered extremity of this, through which was a
small hole communicating with the interior, Walderheros
applied his mouth and exhausted the air.
This being done, he then closed the aperture with
a piece of wax, that had been placed ready for that
purpose around the end of the horn. The usual
tumefaction of the integument immediately beneath
was occasioned by being thus relieved of atmospheric
pressure. After a little time remaining in
this position, a needle was inserted into the wax,
and air being admitted into the horn, it fell off.
Walderheros, with the heel of a sharp razor, then
gave three jerking cuts in the skin, and immediately
replacing the horn over the part, again withdrew the
air, and a slight movement of the tongue closed the
aperture as before with the wax. In a few minutes,
the ascending surface of the blood, seen through
the white semi-transparent horn, indicated that
sufficient had been extracted, and holding down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
my head, at the request of Walderheros, the
primitive instrument was withdrawn, the whole
operation having been performed by these simple
means as speedily and as effectually as with the
most expensive apparatus.</p>

<p>Excepting their acquaintance with some few
cathartic remedies, all derived from the vegetable
kingdom, the Shoans possess but little knowledge
of medicine. A specific effect upon the bowels
appears to be absolutely necessary to convince them
that the remedy employed is medicine; and it is
upon this principle that the articles contained in
their limited “Materia Medica” have been selected.
The only exception to this is a demulcent drink, made
with honey and the mucilaginous seeds of the soof,
<i lang="la">Carthamus tinctorius</i>, which is taken to relieve the
local symptoms of “goomfon” (common catarrh).</p>

<p>The science of medicine principally consists
of mysterious ceremonies, to be observed whilst
collecting the few herbs employed as remedies, and
in a knowledge of certain absurd formula of characters,
which, being inscribed upon a little bit of
parchment, is then enclosed in a case of red leather.
The amulet is worn around the left arm above
the elbow, or among the women around the neck,
attached to the front of the martab. Pieces of red
coral, sea shells, and various other things, are also
believed to have protective powers against diseases.
Copper rings, especially around the ancles or wrists,
are considered to be very efficacious in the cure of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
rheumatism. These kind of remedies are supposed
to be obnoxious to certain demons who afflict the
body during sickness, named “saroitsh,” of which
there are several, but great difference of opinion
exists as to their exact number.</p>

<p>The Shoans have also external applications, and
little operations, by which they remedy the consequences
of accidents, but these are mere exigencies,
conceived at the moment by the most sagacious
of the spectators, and, excepting blood-letting and
cupping, no art or mystery exists among them
worthy of being dignified with the name of surgery.
A strange operation for the removal of the whole
tonsil, when enlarged by inflammation, I have
often heard spoken of, but never had any opportunity
of witnessing, although I believe one of the
Irish soldiers attached to the Embassy, was foolish
enough to submit to the operation, and almost died
in consequence. The mode they employ of blood-letting
and cupping is of very ancient origin, and
appears to have been received from former Egyptian
connexion; as, since my return to England, I
have observed, in some representations preserved
to us of the arts and manners of the people of that
ancient country, the same method of venesection
was adopted by them, as by modern Abyssinians,
and also, I may remark, by their less civilized
neighbours, the Dankalli. This is performed in
Shoa with the blade of a small razor, held between
the fore-finger and thumb. The point of the left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
thumb of the operator is then placed upon the
frontal vein of the forehead, which becoming
turgid, is laid open by a jerking cut with the
razor, and the blood flows freely. Cupping with
the assistance of a cow’s horn, as I have before been
describing, I have also seen practised in exactly
the same manner, by the negroes of the western
coast of Africa, so that this method of abstracting
blood appears to be very general, and strongly
attests a previous civilized condition among the
ancestors of the inhabitants of this continent, as
such a practice argues a greater advance in intellectual
acquirement for its first introduction into
use, than we are willing, ignorant as we are
yet of what civilization exists in the unknown
countries of intertropical Africa, to accord to the
ignorant natives, with whom we are at present
acquainted.</p>

<p>I must not omit to observe, that among other
external remedies, counter-irritation is a very
favourite practice among the Abyssinians. Thus,
in inflammations of the lungs, several small burns
are made upon the chest, either with a red-hot
iron rod, or a piece of burning charcoal, and
this remedial process appears, and, I dare say,
deservedly, to rank high as being very efficacious
in the opinion of the inhabitants. In rheumatism,
also, this kind of treatment, and the disease, is so
common on the high table land of Shoa, that an
exhibition of joints, to intimate how the patients
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
have suffered, is sometimes most ludicrous; our inclination
to laugh, such is man’s nature, not at all
diminishing with increased evidences of the patient
submitting to the barbarous, but still, I have no
doubt, excellent remedy.</p>

<p>Syphilis has been represented to be the curse of
the land; and certainly, from King to beggar,
according to their own account, they either have
it, or are about to have it. Priests and their wives
are not exempt, nor do even children of the tenderest
age escape. The reputation of this disease
is as general among the Shoans, as scrofula is in
England, and it is admitted and spoken of in the
same manner without any reluctance or shame.
This disease is supposed by the natives to originate
from several causes; among others, that of eating
the flesh of fowls which have become diseased, by
living in the neighbourhood of some one more
than usually afflicted, and great care accordingly
is taken, when purchasing fowls in the market, to
learn from whence they came. The prevalent
opinion also is, that it is communicable by the
simplest contact, and those who are suffering from
it are, therefore, carefully avoided, except by their
own relations, and for years after they are quite
cured, a reluctance to eat or drink with them,
except with certain precautions, may be observed
among those of their acquaintance who are aware
of their previous condition. From these and many
other observances against contagion, it may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
surprising that the disease should be so general.
As it struck me as being very remarkable, I
made a point of examining into the subject, and
have concluded that by far the greater majority of
sores, and unhealthy appearances upon the body,
though referred by the patients themselves to this
disease, arise, in fact, from other causes, and are
confounded with syphilis, sometimes, probably,
from the consciousness of having deserved it, but
more frequently from their ignorance of the fact,
that the peculiarity of their situation, and the
character of their system in consequence, predisposes
them to an extensive ulceration, should the
continuity of the skin be separated by the slightest
bruise. The ill effects which arise from this, the
unfortunate sufferers, unable to account for it in
any other manner, refer to a complaint, whose best
known symptoms are of a similar character; and
without any idea of disgrace attaching to them for
what has arisen most innocently, they jump to the
conclusion that they have become contaminated by
an unfortunate contact with some affected individual.
This is one reason, also, of the very
various remedies popularly employed; for many
of the cases, as I have observed, not having the
least taint of syphilis, when a rapid recovery takes
place by the use of any simple cathartic, a reputation
is immediately gained for it, as being a certain
cure for the presumed obstinate disease for which
it has been taken, and which it has so readily subdued.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Many vegetables in this manner are considered
to be most efficacious in this disease,
without the least claim to it, farther, than being
gentle aperients and generally, in consequence,
having a beneficial influence upon the human
frame. On many such mistaken cases, the effect
of blue pill was most wonderful, and it was a
general observation with the medical officers of the
Embassy, the remarkable efficiency of this remedy
upon the Abyssinian human system, when, if its
cause had been examined into, it would have been
found that its simple alterative effects, producing a
healthy reaction, was all that was required to
establish a healing process very rapidly in the
numerous cases of common ulcers, that were prescribed
for under the impression that they proceeded
from one sole cause: that a universal
syphilitic taint characterized the whole population
of Shoa.</p>

<p>The Abyssinians, immoral as they appear to be,
are much more simple than depraved. It is the
virtuous confidence of people afflicted with the
<em>reputed</em> complaint, conscious of having no improper
cause to attribute it to, and still, in their ignorance,
believing it to be syphilis, which has given support
to the general opinion among them of its extremely
contagious character, and which has occasioned
that apparent shamelessness with which this disreputable
and distressing disease is spoken of by all
classes and conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
The most generally employed remedy, for common
purposes, by the inhabitants of Shoa, is the
flowers and unripe seeds of the <i lang="la">Hagenia Abyssinica</i>,
called by them “Cosso.” Bruce gives us a good
description, and was the first who directed the
attention of Europeans to this remarkable tree.
In Shoa it grows frequently to the height of fifty
feet. About one half of the way up the Tchakkah
ascent, it flourishes remarkably well. It appears
to be a short-lived tree. Of its wood the Negoos
has all his gun-stocks manufactured, as it approaches
nearly in colour to that employed for the
same purposes in the European firearms he possesses.
The wood, however, is far from being
strong; but whilst the colour satisfies the eye of
the monarch, the workmen he employs find it is
well adapted, by its soft nature, to their tools, and
its excellence for the purposes required is therefore
never questioned, except by the unfortunate gunman,
who, when the stock of his piece is fractured
by any accident, must submit to a stoppage in his
rations or pay, until its value has been reimbursed
to the monarch, who always takes this
method of ensuring carefulness as regards valuable
property.</p>

<p>The cosso tree, as was remarked by Bruce, does
not grow below a certain elevation, which is about
eight thousand feet above the level of the sea, in
the 10th degree of latitude north of the equator.
It is a very beautiful tree in appearance, and, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
think, would grow very well in England. Its
leaves are largely pennated, and of a lively green
colour; a great deal brighter than the foliage of
the chesnut-tree, which, in figure, the cosso somewhat
approaches to, except that it is not quite so
high. The flowers are of a blood red colour, and
hang in large bunches, sometimes a foot or a foot
and a half long, consisting of numerous small
flowerets attached to one common footstalk. Amidst
the bright green leaves of the tree, these drooping
crimson masses have a very picturesque appearance.
Cosso-trees do not seem to be so carefully
cultivated at the present day in the country to
the west of Tchakkah, as they appear to have
been when the Sara and Durra Galla tribes
occupied the country between the Barissa and
Angolahlah. We find them now generally marking
the sites of former Galla villages. On riding
off the road on one occasion to examine a group
of these trees, a civil herdsman conducted Walderheros
and myself into a cave of some extent
where cattle used formerly to be kept by the
Galla, whom I then learned, in this situation had
their principal town.</p>

<p>The fruit of the cosso is gathered for medicinal
purposes before the seeds are quite ripe, and whilst
still a number of the flowerets remain unchanged.
The bunches are suspended in the sun to dry, and
if not required for immediate use deposited in a
jar. Cosso is taken in considerable quantities to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
the market, where it is disposed of in exchange for
grain or cotton, a handful of the latter, or a drinking-hornful
of the former, purchasing sufficient for
two doses, two large handsful. When taken, this
medicine is reduced upon the mill to a very fine
powder, having previously been well dried in the
sun upon a small straw mat, upon which from some
superstitious reason or other, several bits of charcoal
are placed. The largest drinking-horn being then
produced, the powdered cosso is mixed with nearly
a pint of water, and, if it can be obtained, a large
spoonful of honey is also added. When everything
is quite ready, a naked sword is placed flat upon the
ground, upon which the patient stands. The nurse
then takes between two bits of sticks, as a substitute
for tongs, a small bit of lighted charcoal, and carries it
around the edge of the vessel three times, mumbling
a prayer, at the end of which the charcoal is
extinguished in the medicine, which is immediately
drank off by the patient, who all this time has been
pulling most extraordinary faces, expressive of
his disgust for the draught. The operation is
speedy and effectual, and to judge by the prostration
of strength it occasioned in my servants, when
they employed this medicine, it must be dreadfully
severe. I can answer for this, that it occasions
frequent miscarriages, often fatal to the mother,
and even men have been known, after a large dose,
to have died the same day from its consequences.
I am, therefore, surprised at the noise this remedy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
has occasioned the last few years in Europe, as if it
promised to be a valuable addition to our Materia
Medica. This, I conceive, can never be, for no
civilized stomach could bear the bulk of the drug
necessary to produce its effects. Even in Abyssinia
it is but barely tolerated, and let another remedy,
equally efficacious for dislodging tape-worm be
introduced into that country, and the use of cosso
will be soon abandoned. In fact, several other
vegetable productions are now employed to escape
the punishment of a dose of this violent cathartic.
Among many I could enumerate, but without any
benefit arising from the list, is the “kolah,” the
same berry which is used in making the “barilla”
tedge, also the red berries of a climbing plant
called “inkoko,” growing in the forest at the foot
of the hill of Kundi, near Michael wans. These
are swallowed whole, like pills, but a very great
number are required to produce the desired
results.</p>

<p>Besides the use of the cold bath, employed in the
manner I have before related, and which may be of
considerable benefit in some diseases, I have no
notes upon any other medical treatment employed
by the Shoans, excepting that from which I derived
considerable benefit in my intermittent; the vapour
bath, prepared by putting several species of odoriferous
herbs, such as wormwood, rue, bergamot,
and some others in boiling water, and then placing
the vessel beneath a large tobe, I was wrapt up in,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
and which was securely fastened around my neck
and in front, to prevent the escape of the vapour of
the medicated decoction. This kind of bath was
always followed by profuse perspiration, and
assisted materially to relieve the violence of reaction
in the hot stage, by accelerating that relaxation
of the pores of skins which marks the return
of something like comfort to the suffering patient.</p>

<p><i>August 8th.</i>—Felt a great deal better after the
cupping, and even proposed, as the Negoos was
now at his palace at Michael wans, about six miles
distant from Aliu Amba, that either on the morrow
or the next day after, I should take the gunpowder
which we had begun very early this morning
to manufacture. Tinta sent me a good pair of
English scales, several wooden mortars, and two
handmills, with a party of labourers, consisting of
eighteen or twenty men and boys. One request he
made was, that as he desired to learn how to make
gunpowder, I would not, therefore, commence
weighing and mixing the ingredients till he could
come to me.</p>

<p>My garden now exhibited a lively scene, several
men standing around huge mortars two feet and a
half high, made out of the round trunks of trees,
and pounding the charcoal, or else the saltpetre
into fine powder. The pestles consisted of heavy
pieces of wood three feet long, which were generally
kept going up and down by two men standing
opposite each other, and who were relieved three or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
four times in the course of an hour. Several others
were on their knees upon the ground, leaning over
coarse flat stones, grinding the sulphur beneath
another heavy one they moved about with the
hands. Some hours were employed in this occupation,
for it was long before the several materials
were reduced to a sufficiently fine powder to commence
mixing them together. It was too much to
expect such another fortunate accident, by which
the supply of charcoal had been obtained, and as I
knew quite as little of the manufacture of gunpowder,
I was very much afraid I should fail in this
attempt also; I determined, however, it should not
be for want of pounding, and to encourage the men,
sent Wallata Gabriel with an ahmulah to purchase
some ale.</p>

<p>Tinta came very soon after, and with him, a
learned scribe, who had been desired by the Negoos
to watch the proceedings, and mark the proportionate
amounts of saltpetre, charcoal, and sulphur,
I used. The scales were produced, and then it was
discovered there were no weights, but this difficulty
I soon got over by employing bullets, and having
duly apportioned the necessary amount of each
ingredient, they were thrown together into the
largest mortar, with water sufficient to make a stiff
paste. A second pounding match now commenced,
for to do the business effectually, I divided the mass
into three portions, which I placed in separate
mortars, and set as many couples at work again.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
The constant fear, that the whole party was now
in, was most ludicrous. I was scarcely permitted
to sit a moment—here, I was wanted—there, I must
go and look, and the other mortar would, perhaps,
be actually deserted; and all arose from a suspicion
that an explosion would take place; water was
continually being added, and the least approach to
friableness frightened the workmen, as if a hot
cinder was about to be thrown into a barrel of
dry gunpowder. However, I managed to keep
them to their guns until sunset, when they were
discharged, without any casualty, from the dangerous
duty; for which, I don’t know, if the Negoos has
not rewarded some of them for military service.</p>

<p>After Tinta, scribe, and all were gone, then my
anxious moments came as to my success. A small
quantity being taken out of the mortar, was placed
upon paper near the fire, and soon drying, Walderheros
had the immortal honour of firing the first
sample, which flashed off in the most approved
manner, much to the delight of Wallata Gabriel,
and Goodaloo, and in fact, of us all, and more
especially of myself, as I least expected it.</p>

<p><i>August 9.</i>—Tinta was at my house, as soon as it
was light, and as I had put the evening before
a small portion of the damp powder in the fragment
of a jar, and placed it among the warm
ashes of the hearth, sufficient for two charges, was
quite dry and ready for proofing when he came.
I soon loaded my double-barrelled carabine, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
having examined the nipples of the locks, covered
them with caps. The shoulder-bone of an ox was
our make-shift target, and each taking a shot at
the distance of about forty yards, both of us were
successful in perforating it with the balls.</p>

<p>It was now determined, that Tinta should provide
me with a mule, and that next day I should follow
him to Michael wans, usually pronounced Myolones,
to bring the gunpowder and present it to the Negoos.
Accordingly, Walderheros returned with Tinta to
his house, and after some hours brought me back a
mule; during which time, I and Goodaloo, dividing
the powder into small portions, dried them well
before a low red fire of the spare charcoal. The
temerity of the latter was extraordinary, but it was
quite in keeping with the silent steady manner he
always performed any service I required. The
large grains of the powder being afterwards forced
through a sifting basket of grass, used in fining
flour, I then secured it in a quart bottle I
happened to possess; and which it about two-thirds
filled.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>August 10th.</i>—It had rained very heavily all night,
and as the sky was covered with clouds, I did not
feel inclined to go to Myolones. Walderheros,
however, had set his mind upon it, and as the ride
was a very short one, and might, perhaps, be of
service in many respects, I at last consented.
Walderheros had the mule ready before I could
change my mind, and giving some precautions to
Wallata Gabriel to look after everything well whilst
we were away, and to let no one enter the house
upon any pretence, off we started, Goodaloo running
before, with the skin containing my bed-clothes upon
his head, and Walderheros following slowly after
me, having in special charge the very precious bottle
of gunpowder.</p>

<p>We proceeded along the narrow arid winding
path, that leads down the steep western slope of
the rock of Aliu Amba. Here the road is deeply
worn in the hard stone, so as to form a kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
hollow way, upon each bank of which thick bushes
of a large strong-leaved plant, meeting above the
head of the traveller, forms an umbrageous tunnel,
nearly impervious to the sun’s rays. At the bottom
of the descent we crossed a stream, yellow with
suspended earth, for, like most other rivers of
Shoa, during the wet season, its running water is
an active agent of denudation. We now slowly
ascended the opposite bank of the valley, and
passing through the little Christian village upon its
summit, called Aitess, we then again descended to
the level of another stream, along whose miry
banks, crossing and re-crossing it several times in
its tortuous course, we at length reached, where, in
a narrow cascade, the water falls suddenly the
distance of two hundred feet, with the usual
rushing din of an impetuous torrent. Here the
bald face of a rock, across which not the trace of a
road could be perceived, projected a smooth surface
of compact stone, from beneath a super stratum
of a loose schistose formation of several hundred
feet high, whilst below us appeared an almost perpendicular
wall, with just such a sliding inclination
as suggested an idea of the bridge said to be situated
by some Orientalists between heaven and earth, for
there required scarcely the impetus of a wish, to
have slipped from life to death during the walk
across. The earthquake that ushered in the rains
had occasioned this obliteration of the road, for the
effects of some thousands of tons of the overlying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
detritus which had been detached, with bare
skeleton branches of overturned trees protruding
amongst the ruins, were visible over the devastated
fields of vetches and horse-beans that occupied the
bottom of the large valley into which we had
opened, where the stream we had previously kept
along, fell over the waterfall into this the bed of
the principal tributary of the Dinkee river. This
fallen earth, scattered far and wide, had converted
the green appearance of large tracts of
cultivated lands, with the crops far advanced, to
the condition and character of a freshly ploughed
fallow.</p>

<p>I halted when I arrived at the dangerous pass,
to see if there were not another passage somewhere
else, and looked up and down, but saw no way
available but the one back again, which, as I had
come so far, I did not choose to take, so at once
put the question of its practicability to my mule by
urging her forward, willing to depend upon instinct
not leading the animal into a position, where she
was not perfectly satisfied that her preservation was
well assured. The termination of the road, where
its continuity had been swept away by the land-slip,
was opposite and in sight; and with this
encouragement, and perhaps satisfied, that her rider
was a reasonable creature, and would not attempt
anything impracticable, the mule did not hesitate
the least, and on my intimation to proceed, began
carefully to place her feet, one after the other, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
the sloping rock, and slowly entered upon the
death-inviting scene. After we had started, and it
was impossible to come back, as usual I began to
think of the value of life, and the little courage
that man really has, just sufficient to make
him take the first step into peril, and then, from
despair, or the recklessness of a suicide, bear himself
up against all contingencies, and comes out
a brave man if he lives, with the certainty of being
thought a wretched fool if he is killed. With
teeth set, and eyes fixed upon the yawning gulph
on one side, I muttered to my mule, as if she had
been my murderess, “my blood be upon your
head,” and to her folly, not my own, attributed my
present perilous position. Once I looked upon the
other side, but there, overhanging, as if suspended
by the air which it projected into, was the high
black wall of the loose angular fragments of an
easily fractured schistose rock, which seemed as if
a thousand ton torrent of stones was suspended
only whilst I passed, to follow in one rush of ruin
the land-slip which, but a few mornings before, had
been detached and, precipitated into the foaming
river below, carrying along with it many acres of
jowarhee and cotton plantations. My carefully
slow mule seemed to invite the catastrophe, and
it was long after I had really passed the horrible
ordeal, before the conscience-stirring scene lost its
repentant effect upon my mind.</p>

<p>Having got safely over this delicate pass of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
about one hundred yards long, I turned round to
look after Walderheros. I found he had not dared
to attempt it until he saw that I had reached the
end of the road, when he came cautiously along,
making no reply to my loud shout of caution that
he should take care of the bottle. He looked
perfectly satisfied, however, when he saw himself
landed upon sound ground again, after a little
spring over the two or three last feet of the
distance, impatient even then of peril impending.
Away we went, talking over the rash feat, and
determined not to come back that way again if we
could help it. A little reaction, too, consequent
upon the excitement had taken place, and I no
longer felt fatigued as I had done before, but
proceeded in much better spirits. The hill, or a
prolonged height of Lomee, was now crossed,
covered almost entirely with fields of the common
horse-bean, whose grey blossoms perfumed the
whole neighbourhood. Generally, the fields were
quite green with young grain but a few inches
high, and through these our road lay for nearly
an hour, when, by a gradual descent, we found
ourselves upon the edge of a coarse gravel bank,
that in this situation had been cut into a perpendicular
cliff, about thirty feet high, by the action
of the confined, impetuous river that rushed around
its base. The river is here called “Gindebal
wans,” the tree-eating stream, and is singularly
characteristic, like most other Abyssinian names of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
localities. Here, in the little reaches that
alternated with rough stone waterfalls, were numerous
trunks of the sigbar, ted, and “<i>waira</i>,” or
wild olive tree, which had been brought down
from the forests that surround its remotest sources.
Through the dark green mass of foliage could be
observed, in several places, broadly cut channels,
produced by the crashing boulders from the edge
of the table land behind, detached by the late
earthquake, and it is such an agent, rather than
the denuding effect of the stream itself, that
occasions such vast numbers of these trees that
are annually floated down the “Gindebal
wans.”</p>

<p>I considered that it would be hopeless to attempt
fording this stream, for although above it widened
considerably, and was spread over a rocky cascade,
still between the huge stones that there appeared
above its surface, wide channels existed, and
however shallow the water might be, the swiftness
of the current would have turned a man
over like a leaf. At all events the mule would
not take me over, and so I sat down whilst
Walderheros was looking out for the ford, leaping
from stone to stone, and instructed by Goodaloo,
who, on the other side, was shouting out directions,
which were very indistinctly heard amidst the
noise of the torrent. His appearance alone demonstrated
the possibility of the passage, but seeing
him in a very short time joined by Walderheros,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
who, for a few moments had disappeared, I got up
to see what success I might have. Walderheros
having given the bottle containing the gunpowder
to Goodaloo, returned to assist me, and I soon
found that by a very indirect mode of progress, successively
leaping in different directions, the opposite
bank was being gained. The mule came clattering
after me, jumping like a cat, her four feet
occupying sometimes the summit of a stone not
the size of a dinner-plate, and sometimes scratching
up on to a high rock, as if she had strong claws
rather than smooth horny hoofs. I kept a sharp
look out behind, for though she was making use
of me as a guide, she came so fast that, occasionally,
a very summary kind of ejectment precipitated me
forward, to make room for her upon the stone.</p>

<p>After reaching the opposite bank we all sat
down to rest ourselves, previous to commencing
an ascent before us, that if not so steep, seemed
to promise to be as long as that of Tchakkah. As
I looked up I could not help expostulating with
Walderheros for having persuaded me, ill as I was,
to undertake a journey which I had calculated
would only occupy me an hour, and here we had now
been that time, and by his own confession we were
not half way yet. Some consolation was afforded
by the sun breaking out, and enlivening me by
its warmth and brightness. I mounted my mule
again, and with a desperate resignation faced the
rugged steep. Half an hour we were climbing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
this stone ladder before we reached the little town
upon its summit, called Dubdubhee. In one of
the best houses the mother of Walderheros lived,
so here it was resolved to stay and breakfast,
having, after the usual Abyssinian custom, brought
the meal with us. Of course, I alone partook, as
the observance of the fast required my servants to
abstain from food until evening.</p>

<p>The mother of Walderheros lived with a second
husband, by whom she had had several children.
Her first husband, the father of Walderheros,
occupied a farm a short distance from Myolones,
and he also had married again, and had another
numerous family by his second wife; so what
between both parents, my servant was very well
off for parental and fraternal relations, a thing,
too, which he considered to be a great advantage;
especially as all parties were still on the very best
of terms.</p>

<p>From Dubdubhee, the road to Myolones was along
a narrow ridge, similar, in many respects, to that in
front of Ankobar, and it was not until the shallow
circular valley of Myolones spread below us in full
sight, that we commenced a short descent into it;
having first passed close to the side of the grove of
the new church of St. Michael, the cone-like thatched
roof of which was terminated by a wooden cross, on
the top, and on the two arms of which were fixed
ostrich eggs; these eggs, by-the-by, are favourite ornaments
of Abyssinian churches; one that I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
brought up to Shoa with me from the Adal country
had been begged from me by Tinta, who presented
it as a desirable offering, to the priests of the church
of St. George, on the road from Aliu Amba to
Ankobar.</p>

<p>The palace, a number of long thatched residences,
enclosed by a strong stockade, and surrounded with
ted and wild olive trees, occupied the left side of
the valley, as we approached from the east. A
little spur, projecting into the valley, affords a convenient
perch, and the side opposite to us was
dotted with white tobed courtiers, and numerous
individuals passing and repassing, formed a lively
scene. The heights of Kundi and Mamrat behind,
enveloped in fogs, and the sun struggling through
a thick bank of clouds, made everything seem uncomfortable,
which impression was aided considerably
when I dismounted, and found I had to walk
some distance up the palace hill on a moist, soddy
turf, that seemed to hold water like bog-moss.</p>

<p>My arrival was soon notified to the Negoos
whilst I was invited into a large new building of the
usual character, constructed outside of the palace
enclosures, and which was intended for the accommodation
of the numerous train of attendants,
guards, and guests that now followed his Majesty;
and which, having greatly increased by the successes
of his arms and his reputation for wisdom,
had rendered it necessary to enlarge considerably
all the royal residences since he had come to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
throne. The palace of Myolones, however, had
been erected for his own use, numbers of individuals
having been dispossessed of their holdings
to make room for this favourite retirement of Sahale
Selassee; for once or twice during the year the
ordinary public business is suspended, and here the
monarch indulges in a short relaxation for fourteen
or fifteen days.</p>

<p>As I was told two or three times of the manner
in which the people who previously held the land
had been driven from Myolones, I made particular
inquiries to learn if any injustice had marked this
course, for I felt naturally so inclined to respect the
character of Sahale Selassee, that I was jealous of
allowing myself to be deceived by false appearances,
into the belief that he was the admirable character
I could not help taking him to be.</p>

<p>Walderheros’ own father was one of those who
were thus ejected, but when I asked him what
return he had received, said promptly that his
present farm had been given to him in exchange,
and seemed perfectly satisfied with the conduct of
the Negoos. Goodaloo also represented that every
one so removed was more than compensated for
their loss. I had, therefore, no reason to suppose
that the fair fame of Sahale Selassee had been
tarnished at all by this transaction, for although
any opposition to the wishes of the Negoos would, I
have no doubt, have been severely punished, and
summary ejectment have been enforced, yet I do not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
see how any frail human being, educated a despotic
monarch, could help feeling angry should his presumed
rights be questioned in such a manner by a
subject. I contend, therefore, that no injustice was
committed in the apparently arbitrary taking possession
of the valley of the Michael wans, when the
previous possessors of the land were remunerated,
as that is all our own Parliament demands on the
occasion of carrying out any public works.</p>

<p>When William Rufus formed the New Forest in
Hampshire, his situation and circumstances were as
nearly parallel as possible with those of the present
King of Shoa, yet we are told that he did not observe
towards the ejected inhabitants, that justice which
characterized the proceedings of the Abyssinian
monarch.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I declined</span> taking a seat in the waiting-room outside
the palace-courts, as I thought that by being
reported waiting at the gate, I might be called
sooner to an audience with the Negoos. It was
not long before Tinta, who had already arrived at
the palace, came to inform me that after some little
business was concluded with the superior of the
Church in Shoa, the Negoos would see me. A crowd
of idle courtiers had now surrounded me, amusing
themselves with the gunpowder, tasting it, smelling
it, and giving their opinion, and questioning
Walderheros how it was made. A judicious
silence, however, obtained for my servant the credit
of knowing fully how it was prepared; he was wise
enough to keep his ignorance to himself, and then,
as he remarked afterwards, nobody knew anything
about it. Tinta had also got something to ask me,
but as it was very private, and there was no other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
place to retreat to, he spoke to the outer gatekeeper,
who admitted us both into the intervening
space between the only two stockades which surround
the palace of Myolones. Walderheros and
the King’s scribe, who had been sent to take notes
of the process and relative weights of the different
articles used in manufacturing gunpowder,
also accompanied us, and I then found that my
system of weights and measures, by leaden bullets
and table-spoonsful had quite bothered them; and a
most extraordinary report of the business had been
drawn up, which the Negoos soon detected to
be erroneous, and had expressed himself very
dissatisfied with them. They therefore now
applied to me to assist them in their dilemma, and
we accordingly sat down upon some large stones,
and occupied ourselves for some time in getting
a proper statement written down to restore the
Negoos to good humour, and my two friends again
into favour.</p>

<p>A scribe, or “duptera,” as he is called in Shoa,
appears to be an inferior order of priest, at least it
is their first degree, and which is acquired by
merely being able to read and write; nor is it
requisite to pay a visit to Gondar, the seat of the
Abune, or Bishop of all Abyssinia, as is the case
when priests are to be ordained. The usual occupation
of the scribes is principally to transcribe
manuscripts for the Negoos, who has a most extraordinary
desire to be possessed of copies of all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
works in the Geez language, and to procure which,
or, if possible, the originals themselves, he expends
annually a considerable sum. These manuscript
books are all written upon parchment, and bound,
most frequently, into a volume about the size of a
folio. The backs are made of two thin boards,
covered with red leather, which is ornamented very
tastefully by borders and designs impressed by iron
stamps; and for the means they have at their disposal,
the Abyssinians produce in this manner very
creditable specimens of book-binding. For farther
protection, it is usual to have a small leathern case,
which receives the book, and a flap strapped down
then secures it from all accidents.</p>

<p>When engaged writing, the duptera sits upon
the ground, takes from out of his girdle an
ink-horn, the tapering extremity of which being
reduced to a kind of spike, he sticks into the earth
by his side. The ink is a composition of powdered
charcoal and gum arabic or myrrh, with a little water,
and a very permanent ink is thus produced. I may
observe, that excepting in the manufacture of ink,
the Abyssinians of Shoa have no other use for the
gum myrrh, and I have frequently been asked,
“What else could it be used for?” As for using
this gum as medicine themselves, or giving it for
that purpose to their cattle or horses, they have no
idea of any such thing; neither have the Dankalli,
from whose country it is brought into Shoa.</p>

<p>Having placed his ink-horn in the earth, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
scribe then produces a small leathern case, in
which he generally carries a supply of parchment,
a few reed pens, and a large pair of scissors, to clip
off the ridiculously small pieces of parchment upon
which the Shoans write their ordinary letters, which
have not, sometimes, a surface of more than one
inch. A pen being formed, it is carefully examined
by thumb-nail and eye, and is then either nibbled,
to make it soft, or if it be too soft already, it is made
finer by means of a large dinner-knife, which is
generally carried in a small slip, in the scabbard
of the crooked sword that curls its point nearly
up to the shoulder of the right side, on which it is
always worn. Everything being arranged, the
parchment is held fast upon the knee by one hand,
whilst the long and careful inscription is being made.
The process of writing the shortest note is a very
tedious one, for every letter is a capital, and
although the Geez character, as a syllabic alphabet,
is the most correct of any with which I am
acquainted, and best suited for conveying exact
sounds, still the required attention to the proper
situation of the small vowel points, occasions
considerable delay.</p>

<p>Having given Tinta the required information,
which was all carefully written down by the duptera,
they left Walderheros and myself for a few moments,
whilst they went in to the Negoos, with the improved
report. In a very few minutes Tinta returned, and
beckoning for me to come, as he appeared at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
wicket in the second enclosure, I got up, and
followed by Walderheros, entered the inner court,
where I found the Negoos reposing upon a couch
placed on one side of the porch, that leads into
the principal apartment of the palace. All the
buildings were of the same description as those of
the other Royal residences, consisting of a wall of
splintered ted, six or seven feet high, plastered
inside with common red clay, and thatched. Outside
from the projecting eaves were hung in great
numbers, the disgusting trophies of Abyssinian
warfare stuffed with dry grass.</p>

<p>My memolagee, on the occasion of this visit was,
the gunpowder, which, although Tinta had carried
it in previously, with the written account of the
mode of preparing it, had been returned to
Walderheros, so that I might deliver it in person.
The usual Arab word “<i>kaphanter</i>,” did duty for
“How do you do?” and, disfigured as the countenance
of the monarch is by one sightless orb, which
is more striking from its mottle pearly hue,
contrasting with the dark brown colour of his face,
still, I consider, the expression of the monarch’s
features to be pleasing and good-natured. He
received the bottle containing the gunpowder, and
uncorking it, poured out a little into the palm of
his hand, and examined it attentively, and evidently
with the eye of a man of business. Sahale
Selassee, in fact, is particularly interested in the
production of a good article of the kind, as, could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
he command a good supply of gunpowder, he
would, I am convinced, greatly extend his conquests.
After some examination, he pronounced it to be
genuine; and I then found that he questioned, or
at least, suspected, that it might he adulterated.
A previous traveller had attempted to practise upon
the Negoos, by representing as having been made
in Shoa, some gunpowder he had brought with
him from Europe, and who had been detected by
the knowledge of a little fact, which it had been
presumed, that the clever monarch was not aware
of. The saltpetre obtained in Shoa, although very
plentiful, abounds with another salt, that not
decomposing by explosion leaves a residium of
white globules which, besides fouling the barrels of
the guns, deteriorates, considerably, the exploding
effects of the powder; so much so, that an ordinary
charge for a common musket, is two or three large
handsful, and it is nothing unusual to see the
ram-rod, after loading, projecting twelve, or even
eighteen inches beyond the muzzle. The presence
of this salt occasions the powder to be of a very
light grey colour, not unlike wood-ashes. From
not possessing any chemical tests, I was unable to
decide its mineral character, but I supposed it to
be the nitrate of soda.</p>

<p>Besides the gunpowder, I had taken with me,
not as a memolagee, but as a present for the
Queen, a beautifully worked black lace veil,
which had been made for a very different personage,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
and for a more suitable character, a
bright-eyed daughter of Spain. Not, however,
having been thrown upon the southern coast of
that country during the past three years, and considering
it was not very likely that I should be for
the next two or three more, I determined to return
the politeness of the Queen of Shoa, by presenting
it to her, as she had sent me presents of wheaten
bread, with inquiries after my health, several times
during the last month. Of course, I had no
chance of giving it into her own hands as, like all
the other of the Royal wives and concubines, she
is carefully secluded from the gaze of ordinary
mortals. Her name, <i>Bashabish</i>, conveys a compliment
of no little meaning, being literally, “By
thee I have increased,” which alludes to the two
sons with which she has blessed Sahale Selassee;
the elder, named Hylo Malakoot, and the younger,
Safie Selassee, or the “Sword of the Trinity,” as his
father’s name signifies the “Given of the Trinity.”
The latter is the favourite son, and as the crown is
not hereditary, but the King nominates his successor;
as David, we are told, in like manner, chose his son
Solomon, above all his elder brethren; so, to all
appearances, Safie Selassee, on the demise of his
father, will succeed to the throne in prejudice to his
brother. Besides these children, the Negoos has one
or two daughters by his favourite wife, Bashabish.</p>

<p>When I presented the veil, it created quite a
commotion, for its novel texture and the embroidered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
pattern surprised and gratified the Negoos
exceedingly. He threw it over his face to look
through it, tried the strength of the thread, and
seemed much amused at the idea of its being
merely a “<i>guftah</i>” (woman’s head dress), for he
had taken it to be intended for some dignitary of
the Church, to be worn over the shoulders. However,
the usual “Egzeer ista,” and what I required
from him, being asked, after I had stated that I had
only to return my thanks for the house he had
given to me, and had no request to make, the usual
abrupt recommendation of me to the care of Heaven,
and “you may go,” terminated the interview.</p>

<p>I was not taken back to the shed outside the
palace courts, but into a much more comfortable
apartment between the two stockades, where I
found several priests sitting upon the ground on
low chairs, employed perusing a book themselves,
or attending to some boys, who, in the usual school
tone, were practising a reading lesson, that I was
told soon after I went in was a chapter of St. Luke.
A few pupils were also receiving their first instructions
in writing. It appeared that this was a
religious institution connected with the palace,
being the residence of these priests, who about
midnight begin chanting their orisons, and keep
the howling concert up until daylight. How it is
possible for the Negoos, or any one residing within
ear-shot of them, to sleep, I do not know, but I do
not exaggerate when I say, that to my ears their holy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
exercises sounded a deal more inhuman, than the
noise made by a pack of famished wolves. The
priests, however, appeared a good-natured set, and
soon spread an oxskin upon the loose dry grass, that
appeared to be collected in large quantities for the
purpose of forming soft beds for the holy fathers,
all of whom, with their pupils, occupied this
thatched apartment. I considered that it formed a
good counterpart of the character of the college of
Oxford in the days of King Alfred, and looked with
interest upon its inmates, when I reflected, that
probably their habits and feelings assimilated with
those of the earliest teachers of our celebrated
University.</p>

<p>A bright fire of wood crackled upon the low
hearth, and I threw myself upon my littered couch
by its side. No inducement existed to tempt me
into the open air, for the sky had now become
covered with low grey clouds, whilst a heavy mist
hid the high romantic cliffs of Kundi, that close
around the head of the valley of Myolones. Sometimes
a puff of wind rolled along before it, a huge
cloud of the condensed moisture, that for a few
minutes enveloped the precincts of the palace in a
dense fog. A thought of rain, however, did not
trouble me, for I was in most comfortable quarters,
on very good terms with the learned monks, and as
Walderheros had been sent for to the palace, and
returned with two bottles of the barilla tedge, I
enjoyed myself exceedingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
“A change came o’er the spirit of the dream,”
for towards evening I began to feel exceedingly
hungry, and urged Walderheros to prepare me
something to eat, as not only had bread, honey,
butter, onions, and, in fact, everything required to
make a sumptuous repast, been sent from the palace,
but a sheep also. I soon learnt that the reluctance
on this occasion shewn by my servant to do as I
desired him was, that the present time being a strict
fast, the monks would not allow their place to be
desecrated by anything like food being cooked in it.
Not relishing the poor fare which, it seems, they
are restricted to during this fast of fourteen days, I
sent Walderheros to the palace requesting an indulgence;
and in about half an hour he came back,
bringing with him Goodaloo, who had remained
outside all this time with the crowd of retainers
and servants, who are not allowed the privilege of
the entrée of the palace. They soon collected my
bed-clothes and presents, having intimated to me
that a fresh place had been appointed, where I could
have the sheep killed and cook whatever I liked.</p>

<p>The monks were anxious that I should understand
that it was public principle alone that
occasioned their apparent inhospitality, and I
readily excused it; for they could not have consistently
enforced a strict observance of the fast
among the household of the Negoos, and yet have
allowed animals to have been slaughtered in their
presence, and flesh meat cooked under their roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
Tinta, as usual, appeared with his servants to
superintend my removal, and after passing out
of the outer gate and through the little belt of ted
and wild olive trees that encircle the palace, we
proceeded a short distance down the valley, where
were three or four tents pitched, and I then saw
one of these was intended for me. My illness,
however, had made me rather particular, and
instantly I saw that I was about to be quartered in
such a residence as that, I objected, pointing very
feelingly to the sloppy spongy turf, and the dirty-looking
clouds that floated lazily above our heads.
At the request of Tinta, however, I went to look at
the accommodations, and was certainly better satisfied,
when I found that one larger tent outside
enclosed a very snug new one, leaving a large
space between the two surfaces. Besides, a high
and very commodious alga, or bedstead, had been
brought, so that, excepting from the vapour rising
from the moist earth, I could be in no danger of
being exposed to any damp, and feeling pleased at
the arrangements that had been made for my
comfort, I raised no more objections, but took my
place upon the bed, and after a bright fire had
been lighted upon a temporary hearth of large
stones, Tinta and his train departed, leaving me to
enjoy myself, until Walderheros should have prepared
supper, by reading a pocket volume of
“Childe Harold” I had brought with me.</p>

<p>It was not long after the sun had set behind a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
high bank of clouds than a drizzling rain came on,
and although I did not like this symptom of a wet
night, I was satisfied by Goodaloo going and
procuring a hoe, with which he soon pecked up,
around the outside tent, a large gutter to carry off,
and thus prevent the water that might fall, spreading
over the floor inside. After seeing this done, and
partaking of supper, I soon fell fast asleep, as comfortably
as if I had remained in the warm close-thatched
residence of my learned friends.</p>

<p>Before midnight, however, the storm that had
been brewing the two or three days previously
around the cliffs of Aramba, Kundi, and Mamrat,
progressed gradually but rapidly to its fullest
development. The Scotch mist of the evening
increased to a sharp rain, which soon after came
down as if the windows of heaven had opened,
and another deluge was approaching; in a very
short time, not only were both tents soaking, but
before I awoke even, every article of clothing I
had on was completely wet through. The fire,
fortunately, had been kept in, and a large bundle
of wood having been placed between the two tents,
we were in no fear of being left without that
comfort. The first thing, when I awoke to the
misery of my situation, was to send Walderheros
to the house situated outside of the palace stockade,
but he could get no attention paid to his representations,
they were all as bad off, they said,
as myself, the new roof of their apartment letting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
in water at every part. He was equally unsuccessful
at the palace, for no one could be made
to hear the loud summons at the outer gate, the
cold and rain having driven in the wardens to
some retreat, and probably amidst the noise of the
tempest man’s voice was lost; so Walderheros,
after some time, returned to the tent unsuccessful,
and nearly half drowned.</p>

<p>The night would have just suited Byron, provided
he had been wrapt up in some good
macintoshes, for now increased the fierce contention
of the elements of fire and water. Thunder in the
distance boomed heavily, and, quick as the blow of
wrath, its dinning <i>rat tat</i> seemed to break the
electric cloud directly over head; whilst bright
leaping flashes of the most vivid lightning pierced
the darkness of tempest and of night with a
moment’s triumph. Like a bright spear-head
glaring for an instant upon a broad buckler of
dingy hide, night’s darkness, more darkly opposed
the recoiling shaft of light, and the muttering echo
of the retiring peal, seemed to curse the innoxious
effect of its spent force upon earth and her
inhabitants.</p>

<p>I sat upon my heels shivering in the middle
of my rude bedstead, where the concavity that
formed by my weight being in the centre of my
hide mattress, made a good pickling tub, and I
was very soon ankle deep in a pool of water,
whilst to increase the pleasantness of our situation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
the rain succeeded, against every endeavour to
prevent it, in putting out the fire.</p>

<p>It was a sad night, and most uncomfortable were
my forebodings, whilst Goodaloo, silent and stirless,
never moved from the position he had taken after
the last vain attempts to keep up a blaze. Walderheros
seemed to talk faster the faster it rained,
now anathematizing the lazy occupants of the
outhouse, then trying to convince me of his
superhuman efforts to arouse the gate-keepers of
the palace, and sometimes consoling me with the
truism that morning must come, and all would be
well again. So far he was right, for after suffering
nearly a martyrdom during the tedious progress of
the early morning hours, no sooner did the light of
day begin to appear than the persecuting element
stayed its violence, and the recreant rain retired
in misty fogs to its fastnesses among the heights in
the rear of Myolones.</p>

<p>By sunrise the sky was nearly clear of clouds,
birds were singing, and the noise of laughing men
told of a reaction in nature, in which I could have
gladly participated, but that I was well nigh exhausted,
and could scarcely walk to the college of
the monks, several of whom now came to beg that
I would return to the shelter of their residence;
where they said I might eat as much bread and
“dillock” as I liked, without any further observation
from them.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>August 13th.</i>—Every endeavour was now made by
the worthy priests to obviate any ill effects from
the exposure during the night; fresh billets were
piled upon the hearth, and dry clothes being sent
for from the palace, with Walderheros’ assistance I
was soon dressed as a southern Abyssinian. I did
not look to advantage, certainly, in my new suit,
for the <i>sennafil</i>, a pair of very loose petticoat
drawers, fastened by a thick, but soft, cotton rope
around my waist, left my white thin legs bare for
more than a hand’s-breadth above the knee. In
lieu of my shirt the long <i>mekanet</i>, or girdle, a
narrow band of cloth one cubit wide, and sometimes
twenty or even thirty cubits long, was wrapt
around my loins, being spread open over my chest,
and behind almost as high as my shoulders. It is
not usual for the Abyssinians to wear this in the
house, but as I thought that I was not quite
bound by their habits, considering my present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
weak state, I had put it on as a substitute for a
shirt. Over all was thrown a most comfortable
thick cloth of the softest cotton, more like a light
blanket than anything else. This part of the
dress, which is called <i>legumbigalla</i>, is about four
times the size of a Scotch plaid, and worn very
much in the same manner, but is an ordinary, not
extraordinary, article of clothing, and is hardly
ever off the shoulders of an Abyssinian, except
when occupied in some laborious duty.</p>

<p>Being thus attired in the costume of the country,
and having drank a bottle of the very strongest
barilla tedge, I felt quite recovered, and in reply
to a message from the Negoos, inquiring if I were
well enough to wait upon him that morning;
proposed going at once to the palace, as I was
anxious, whilst under the influence of the reaction,
to get over a considerable portion of the fatiguing
road home.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock, however, before a second
messenger from the Negoos desired me to go
immediately to see him, as he wanted me to give
an opinion upon the respective merits of a number
of rifles and other guns. Accordingly, on arrival at
the palace, I was ushered into an inner apartment
beyond the large central room, and which corresponded
with the porch on the front side, where
I had seen his majesty the day before. This
opened, however, into a private court, at the farther
end of which, was the house assigned to the female
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
part of the royal household, as a residence. In the
back porch, if I may so term it, therefore, I found
the Negoos reclining upon a couch covered with a
white cloth, and the usual yellow satin cushions at
each end. He was in his customary dress, a large
legumbigalla, like the one I had on, only ornamented
with numerous bars of the red and blue shumlah,
which adds considerably to the value of the cloth.
He had also on his feet a pair of red Turkish
slippers and white socks, the only European articles
of dress he had adopted, and these he only wore in the
palace; for whenever I have seen him in the fields
around his palaces, he was always barefooted like
his courtiers. I have often regretted that I, at
that time, did not know how to knit, nothing
would have pleased the monarch so much as to
have learned the process, and seen growing beneath
his fingers a well-formed stocking. In a
cold country, situated like Abyssinia, knitting
would be a most useful art to introduce among the
natives, and I hope, therefore, if any traveller
intending to visit that country reads this book, he
will make himself acquainted with that mysterious
accomplishment, which I can assure him is much
easier than he may suppose.</p>

<p>Upon the ground before his Majesty lay some
twenty or thirty fowling pieces and rifles, and
several pages and attendants were bringing in
others from the private armoury, where he keeps
the more valuable of his fire-arms. An ox skin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
was brought and laid down for me to sit upon, and
his Majesty then began to examine me in my knowledge
of his language, but he soon got tired of conversing
with me in my halting Amharic, and
directing my attention to the guns, inquired of me
to tell him which was the best among them; I
knew very well that he was a much better judge
than myself, and told him so, but unfortunately truth
will never be believed in a court, and he supposed
I was complimenting him, and insisted upon my
pointing out the strongest, that he might take it
with him on the next “<i>zemitchar</i>” or expedition
against the refractory Galla tribes, which would
be during the next month.</p>

<p>On looking over the very decent collection which
he had made during his reign by the contributions
of various travellers, who had visited his kingdom,
I observed a rifle, manufactured by Theophilus
Richards, of Birmingham, and pointed it out to the
Negoos as having been made in the town I came
from, and as being one of the best. He took it out
of my hands as he said, “Agger sou?” (townsman?)
and cocking and uncocking it, as if there had been
music in the sound, remarked that it was his greatest
favourite, and, as if, because I had come from the
same neighbourhood, I must be a gunmaker,
added, “You know all about guns, and when you
are quite well, you must teach my servants how to
make them.”</p>

<p>After nearly an hour’s conversation upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
same subject, he bid me “Good bye,” in the usual
abrupt manner, and I retired with Walderheros
to the house of the monks, followed by Tinta, who
had been present the whole of the interview, and
who now congratulated me upon the position I
stood in with regard to the Negoos. I certainly
did not attach that importance to his friendship as
he seemed to do, although I felt gratified at the
attention my endeavours to serve him and his
subjects appeared to command.</p>

<p>By the time we returned to the college, my wet
clothes were all dried, and I soon divested myself
of the Abyssinian costume and resumed my usual
appearance.</p>

<p>There being, however, every prospect of the rain
recommencing, we were all anxious to return to
warm weather and Aliu Amba as soon as possible,
and I only remained sitting with the priests until
my mule was brought up. A large goat that had
been royally fed with barley and salt for the
king’s own table, afforded a tiresome occupation to
Walderheros and Goodaloo, as in turns they took
the long rope attached to his horns, and endeavoured,
much against his inclination, to drag him
along with us. He was as large as a roebuck,
and as contumacious and stiff-necked as well-fed
beasts of all descriptions are apt to be. Now
hanging behind, nothing but being positively
carried up the steep miry hill could induce him
to ascend to the top, but when arrived there, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
afforded every assistance to my servants on the
descent; beginning the war by rearing up on his
hind legs, and with nose pressed down upon
his chest, darted like a flying battering ram, upon
his persecutors, who generally went to the bottom
of the hill by one application of the sort. In this
manner he compelled us to come to terms, and
when we arrived at Dubdubhee, Walderheros left
him in charge with his mother, who was to take
every care of him for the few remaining days of the
fast; at the conclusion of which, he was destined
to form a prominent actor in the festivity, which
it is usual among the Shoans to indulge in, the day
after any term of abstinence has expired.</p>

<p>After remaining nearly all day at Dubdubhee,
where my ague paroxysm came on, and obliged me
to stay, we again started, and arrived at Aliu Amba
a few hours before sunset, where I was right glad
to lay myself comfortably down upon my own bed,
and under my own roof. A bright fire soon blazed
upon the hearth, and my first essay in the art of
brewing was tested, a large gambo of tallah being
brought out of the store recess, a small concavity
being first made in the earthen floor, to receive its
round bottom. The potent beverage was soon being
decanted into large drinking-horns, and the value
of misfortunes to heighten the enjoyment of succeeding
pleasures, was demonstrated by the zest
that the comforts of the night derived, from the
recollection of the miseries of the last we had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
spent at Myolones. My teakettle, half filled with
the ale, was soon heating over the fire, whilst eggs,
and honey, and butter, in another vessel, were being
mixed together for the manufactory of a certain
beverage that Wallata Gabriel protested was to be
a cure for my fever, whilst Walderheros, to expel
the “saroitsh” that I understood had already taken
possession of his hips and shoulders, drew from its
hiding place his clumsy pipe. In the folds of his
mekanet he soon found some tobacco, and breaking
the hard cake in which it is dried into smaller
pieces, charged the slightly excavated stone bowl,
upon the top of which a glowing piece of charcoal
was placed, and consolation and comfort in vast
clouds soon spread through the close apartment.</p>

<p>The “moack,” or egged ale, Wallata Gabriel
now prepared for me, was a drink fit for the entertainment
of the gods when, in the good old times,
they made Abyssinia an annual visit, and from whom
the knowledge of it must have been first derived.
It consisted of two or three drinking-hornsful of
strong tallah, as many eggs, and two large spoonsful
of honey for each horn of beer. A little butter
was added, when the mixture was boiling over the
fire; that which, however, gave to it its pleasantest
flavour was a small portion of a warm spice called
<i>korareema</i>, a large kind of coriander, one inch
and a-half long, which is brought from Gurague,
and the spice country to the south. They are
brought into Shoa by priests travelling to Gondah,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
the only individuals that can traverse in safety the
different Galla tribes to the south of the Hawash,
between their country and Shoa. Forty of these
<i>korareema</i>, threaded upon a strong hempen string,
may be purchased in Aliu Amba for an ahmulah,
and in aromatic flavour are equal, I think, to the
best nutmeg or cloves.</p>

<p>Drunk warm this “moack” was an excellent
cordial, and I very soon got into the habit of concluding
very pleasantly by its assistance many very
uncomfortable days, either from circumstances or
ill-health.</p>

<p><i>August 12th.</i>—Market-day again in Aliu Amba,
and as usual there was a deal of bustle in the
town, and many visitors calling; however, the first
duty to attend to after getting up was the important
business of breakfast. This invariably consisted of
a large teff crumpet which was fresh toasted in
the frying-pan, and well overlaid with butter and
honey. Coffee, having been scorched and pounded
by Walderheros, whilst his wife attended to the
bread, was boiled in an earthenware jar, and black
and strong, was then poured into a cup which
had at one time formed part of the canteen of Lieut.
Barker. He had bestowed it upon an Islam friend
of his, who resided in a neighbouring town, and
who offered it to me in exchange for a small ounce
phial, and a pomatum pot, which I had previously
been obliged to drink out of for want of anything
else. The flavour of the unsugared coffee, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
rendered doubly agreeable by the honey, the
cloying sweetness of which, subduing, and being
subdued, by the bitterness of the berry, left the
pleasant and peculiar aroma of the latter alone
sensible to the palate.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I partaken of breakfast this
morning, before patients and visitors from distant
villages, coming to the market, and taking this
opportunity of calling upon me, thronged around
my house, and memolagees of eggs, butter, and
fowls, would, if I had accepted them all, have most
inconveniently occupied the floor of my house.
Among others, the father of Wallata Gabriel came
for some medicine he required, having long been
labouring under a rheumatic affection of the hip.
As an offering on the occasion, he brought the
entire tapering trunk of a ted tree, more than
fifteen feet long, which I had desired Walderheros
to get me, for the purpose of manufacturing into
an English chair, and also a pair of window frames,
over which I intended to stretch a glaze of oiled
parchment, and place in the outer wall of one of
the recesses, to convert it into a study. Another
daughter of his, named Wallata Selassee, assisted
the old man in carrying the tree, and she brought
me besides, a number of eggs tied up in the girdle
around her waist.</p>

<p>These had not sat long, and before the old man
had finished his doleful story, when another
married daughter of his, her husband, Walder-Yoannes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
and an infant, slung in the lady’s tobe upon
her shoulders, also arrived. They lived in the town
of Lomee, a neighbouring height, visible from my
garden, and about half-way between Aliu Amba,
and Myolones, and coming to market with some
grain, they came to my house, to stay for the day,
with Wallata Gabriel. In accordance with Abyssinian
custom, they had brought their provisions
with them, a large roll of teff bread being taken
out of the mekanet of Walder-Yoannes, and placed
in charge of my housekeeper until after <i>tuzziart</i>,
three o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, when, by the regulations of
the canon law, they might make their first meal for
the day. A pretty noisy party I had now collected
about me, for they talked at the top of their voices,
and had a great deal to say about one thing or
another, and as they were invited to stay the whole
day, and also to make my house their resting-place,
on all other occasions of coming to Aliu Amba,
they soon felt themselves quite at home.</p>

<p>The confused buzzing sound of the distant
market, was audible at my house, and the cries
of the different vendors hawking their wares,
resounded along the narrow winding lanes. <i>Tut
allishe ahmulah</i>, cotton in exchange for a salt-piece.
<i>Burr allishe ahmulah</i>, silver in exchange for
the same. <i>Gaisho allishe tut.</i> All being different
cries, which, with many others, might be heard in
all directions.</p>

<p>My female visitors remaining after their lords
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
and masters had gone to the market, with the usual
industry characteristic of the women of Shoa,
they sat down upon the floor, and chatting away,
commenced spinning cotton; for I had made up my
mind to have a cloth woven at home, from the
first operation of cleaning the cotton, to the weaving
of the last bit of <i>shumlah</i>, in the ornamented
extremity of the tobe. Walderheros had entered
into the spirit of my wish, and had already
exchanged some grain, which we did not require,
for a quantity of raw cotton, as it is taken from
the pods of the plant; in which state it is full
of seeds, and other substances, that have to be
separated by a simple process of cleansing I shall
describe in another place. He had now gone to
market upon the same business, to purchase more
of the raw material, the value of three ahmulahs,
or about thirty pound weight of cotton, being
considered as sufficient for a cloth about eight yards
long, and one cubit broad.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I lay</span> watching the cotton-spinners some time,
thinking upon the effect produced in the human
form by occupation, as I noticed that the arms of
the whole party were the most beautifully moulded I
had ever seen. I could attribute this general characteristic
of Abyssinian women, to no other cause
than the action and exercise dependent upon
spinning, which requires both arms to be in constant
motion, without any heavy labour being imposed
at the same time. The white fleecy cotton, reposing
like a wreath of snow upon the bronze red skin
of the hand and wrist, is gradually carried to its
farthest extent one way, whilst drawing from it the
long slender thread, the other hand conducts, in an
opposite direction, the short thin reed tipped with
a piece of ivory or horn that forms the reel, which
spinning as it hangs, its effect upon the thread
depends upon the slowness or quickness with which
the cotton is drawn out. Continued gentle exercise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
in some light occupation, would lead to somewhat
similar effects in forming a beautiful arm, and I
recommend it to my countrywomen, whom I certainly
thought of when I made the observation in
Aliu Amba.</p>

<p>An unfortunate Arab, named Allee Chous, one
of the discharged servants of the mission, now
came in. He had that morning been robbed of
sixty-three ahmulahs, the last money he had in
the world, and although he hoped to discover the
thief, had nothing with which to purchase his next
week’s provision in the market. I understood the
statement to be an appeal for assistance, and as I
felt some sympathy for his situation, I gave him the
last two salt-pieces I had in the house. Tinta
coming in soon after, I made some inquiries
respecting the police of Shoa, and learned that there
was a regular body of men employed as thief-takers,
called <i>Labarshoitsh</i>, who have an <i>ullica</i>, or
superior, and form a portion of the royal household.
They are agents of the King’s commands alone,
and it is not until directions have been given by
him that they proceed to apprehend culprits. Thieves
must therefore have been denounced by name
before a <i>Labarshi</i> is sent upon his errand. The
Negoos refuses to entertain charges where the
accused parties are unknown, on the same plea that,
according to Abyssinian ideas, the devil will be
repulsed at the last day by our Saviour; on his
demand for justice, the monks say he will be asked
the names of the souls that belong to him, which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
not being able to give, Jesus will then answer,
“Begone from hence, for I know none of thine.”</p>

<p>Most cases of theft, however, are not brought
before the Negoos at all, but before the governors
of the towns in which the crime has
occurred, a summary kind of conviction takes
place, the stolen articles being returned to the
owner, and the property of the thief confiscated,
who, if dissatisfied, can make an appeal to the
Negoos; but in that case he must have very
good evidence of innocence, or he will, in
addition to the loss of his property, receive a severe
flogging, commonly inflicted by the Labarshi, at
the gate of the inner court of the palace, where the
Negoos, if he pleases, may see the punishment.</p>

<p>In cases of suspicion or doubtful guilt, singularly
enough, the Shoans follow certain instructions
which they say are contained in the epistles of St.
Paul, and point more particularly to that passage
in the sixth chapter of Hebrews, where it is said,
“An oath for confirmation is the end of all strife.”
It is, therefore, customary for the accuser and the
accused to present themselves at a church, where
before a priest mutual oaths are required to be
taken; the former swearing to the loss of his
property, the latter that the crime laid to his charge
is unfounded, and there, unless further evidence is
obtained, the matter ends. Should the accused
refuse to purge himself in this manner of the accusation,
it is considered as a confession of guilt, and
the priest then acts as mediator, and generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
receiving a small fine for the use of the Church
from the delinquent, he is made the agent to restore
the stolen property to the rightful owner, and the
affair is quietly hushed up amongst them.</p>

<p>Originally, I believe European lawyers were
priests, and, perhaps, in this portion of the duties of
the clergy in Abyssinia, we have at the present day,
law practice as it existed amongst our ancestors in an
early state of society. In making wills, it may be
also observed, where a number of sons are left
behind, the monks in Shoa are the only executors,
three of them being closeted with the dying father,
receive his commands, and after the celebration of
the <i>tescar</i>, or funeral feast of the deceased, they
then assemble the children, and divide what property
is left, according to the verbal directions of
the testator, and from their allotment there is no
appeal, even if they should disinherit, with a single
ahmulah, the son that has been supposed to have
been the greatest favourite with the father.</p>

<p>Tinta had made the visit to-day, to ask me if I
would accompany him in the evening to visit Abdoanarch,
the new governor, who had expressed a
wish that I should call upon him. I excused
myself upon the plea of ill-health; for I did not
choose that it should be supposed because I was
not upon good terms with the Embassy, that I was
anxious to be friendly with those who avowed open
hostility to the English, and all white men. Tinta
naturally disliked the new governor, so soon agreed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
with me that he was a cunning old fox, and that it
was as well to have as little to do with him as
possible, “for,” said he, “he is older than you,
and cleverer than I am, and he will make us, <i>missala
oolet hiyahoitsh</i>, like two donkies, carry his
grain to market.” Abdoanarch, although crafty,
was not clever, and his first act as governor rather
startled Sahale Selassee, for he released all the
market people from paying the usual toll, and he
ought to have known that the monarch did not
bestow Aliu Amba upon him, for the purpose of
purchasing popularity among some very restless
subjects, the Mahomedans of Efat. No apparent
disapprobation, however, was evinced at this, and the
smiling Abdoanarch, proud in his place of honour by
the side of the King, little suspected how admirably
he was fooled to the top of his bent, like many
others of far superior education were by the master
mind that managed, like those of children, the shallow
intellects that were politically opposed to him.</p>

<p>The only foreigner in Shoa, whilst I was
there, able to compete with Sahale Selassee, was
the Frenchman, M. Rochet d’Hericourt; him the
King liked, and yet feared, but I am afraid he will
now have secured to himself a place high in the
royal confidence, whilst his daring schemes, suited
exactly to the genius of Sahale Selassee, will lead,
I am convinced, to an unlocked for revolution in
the political relations of the various petty kingdoms
into which Abyssinia is at present divided. Our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
Government has no idea of the ability which is
now directing French intrigues in one of the richest
countries upon the face of the earth, and which
can yield within its own limits every valuable product
of the temperate and torrid zone; in that country,
to the northern limits of which the gold
searching expeditions of Mahomed Allee, successful
beyond all European knowledge, have and are
continuing daily to add to his treasury, whilst to
the south, the spices and rich wares of the market
of Zanzibar are now competing with the similar
productions of our East Indian possessions. Our
Government will see, too late, the Phœnician
empire again established in the north of Africa,
supplied by its own inland provinces, with all those
luxuries, for which, at present, Europe is dependent
upon our possessions in Asia. At the same time,
the Americans are successfully nursing on the
Eastern coast a rival market, where their vessels
can be supplied almost upon their own terms, with
those products which, until the last twenty years,
were only to be obtained in English or Dutch
settlements in the East Indies. The policy of the
talented Zaid Zaid, Imaum of Muscat and of
Zanzibar, towards us is apparently the most
friendly; but it is notorious, that in every
indirect manner he can, he favours more highly
the interests of the United States.</p>

<p>Walderheros returning from market, brought a
large bag of cotton, around which the girls all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
thronged to pass judgment upon his purchase.
Tufts of the down-embedded seed were taken out,
and pulled to pieces, handsful were extended in the
light, and after a deal of examination it was
decided “that he might have made a better
bargain, had he taken more trouble about it.” The
cotton was good, but slightly discoloured, which
was attributed to the late rainy weather, as they
asserted its yellowish tint was produced by
moisture, and that it had been allowed to remain
too long upon the tree. Specimens of two very
different kinds of cotton were taken out and shown
to me, one very frizzly, with short fibre, was called
<i>Efatee tut</i>, Efat cotton; the other, with a longer
fibre, and more like unspun silk, was called
<i>Gondaree tut</i>, Gondar cotton, and is by far the
most superior, and none known to America or
Europe equals it in excellence.</p>

<p>Cotton is brought to Aliu Amba, chiefly from
the country around Farree, and appears to flourish
best at an elevation of between three or four
thousand feet above the level of the sea. This is
in latitude 10° north. Some small plantations may
be found, even so high up the scarp of the Abyssinian
table-land as six thousand feet, but these
are not productive, and yield very indifferent
cotton. The young plants require to be from three
to four years old, before they bear available crops
of pods. During this time, the cotton nurseries are
cultivated with jowarhee, though I should think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
not upon any sound principle of husbandry, for the
ripening of the tall grain must interfere with the
full development of the lowly shrub, which is
seldom more than three or four feet high. A
cotton plantation reminded me very much of the
appearance of the vineyard in the south of Europe,
although the little snowball-like tufts of the burst
pods, sprinkle the dark green foliage with numerous
white spots.</p>

<p>My last ahmulahs having been expended, I had
to send Walderheros to market again with a dollar,
whilst I directed my attention, as all other visitors
had departed, to the party now busily employed
cleaning cotton, for as soon as the supply was
brought from the market, Wallata Gabriel and her
sisters, had set about preparing it for spinning.
Flat stones, something larger than bricks, with a
smooth upper surface, were placed upon the ground,
my three factory girls kneeling down before them,
each with an iron rod in her hands, about twelve
inches long, and three quarters of an inch thick in
the middle, and tapering to the extremities. This
instrument is called a <i>medamager</i>; and with it a
small quantity of seeded tufts of cotton, being laid
upon the near end of the stone, is rolled out; the
seeds, by the pressure being forced before the
medamager, until they fall over the farther
extremity of the stone. By this simple, but very
effectual process a large portion of the cotton was
soon in a state fit to be farther cleaned from dust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
and other extraneous matter, and which is the
next part of the process it has to be submitted to
before it is in a fit condition to be spun into
thread.</p>

<p>The instrument employed for this purpose is
called <i>duggar</i>, and is a large bow, the extremities
of which are connected by a strong line of catgut.
The cotton to be operated upon is placed in a
clean soft hide spread upon the floor, whilst a
woman, kneeling, holds the bow in the left hand
over the cotton, so that the string is just high
enough to catch the topmost fibres, whilst with the
other hand, in which she holds the smooth curved
neck of a gourd-shell, she continually keeps twanging
away, each vibration of the string scattering
and throwing up quantities of the lighter filaments,
whilst all heavier matter sinks, as if in a fluid, to
the bottom. The finer portions, upon the summit
of the heap, as it appears satisfactory, is taken off,
and placed carefully in a large covered basket made
of mat, and a fresh supply of the unclean cotton is
added to the heap in the ox skin, when the twanging
process goes on again for a short time longer
until another interval marks the removal of more
of the approved material into the aforesaid covered
receptacle. An instrument, exactly the same as
the <i>duggar</i>, is used in England by hat-makers, to
clean wool and fur for hats.</p>

<p>After the cotton has been cleansed in this
manner, the ox skin is removed, and the dirt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
and dust resulting from the operation thrown
away. The beautifully white dressed material is
then taken out of the basket and piped, by portions
being twined around the medamager, which
being withdrawn, leaves a twisted lock. These, in
numbers of six or seven, are folded together into a
single knot, and laid by in a clean skin bag, until
they are required for spinning into thread.</p>

<p>Long before Walderheros made his appearance
on his return from the market, his voice was heard
in the narrow lane that led from my house. He
always made a practice of thus intimating his
approach by conversing in a loud tone with any
of the neighbours who might happen to be looking
over the top of their inclosure, to examine the
passers by in the hollow way beneath. Talking as
he came along, he never concluded until after he had
entered the wicket of my garden, and as he closed
it behind him, a benediction, that might have been
heard to the market-place, generally finished these
conversations with his friends, just in time to begin
another with me before he had entered the house.</p>

<p>As he now came in he took down from his shoulder
the large goat skin bag, which formed the elegant
purse for about ten pounds weight of salt, the small
change for the dollar he had been nearly two hours
employed in getting. One by one he arranged
the ahmulahs in a long row, like a lot of thin,
narrow bricks, at my feet, that I might sufficiently
admire their bulky character, and compliment him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
upon the excellent choice he had displayed in their
selection.</p>

<p>His labours for the day closed with this, and the
sun being nearly on the point of setting, the cotton
spinners laid aside their reels. The father of
Wallata Gabriel, Goodaloo, and Walder-Yoannes,
all came in from the market together, and fast or
no fast, young and old, on my proposal that they
should taste some of my home brewed ale, a large
gambo was broached, and soon disappeared, whilst
they certainly did confine themselves to a meal of
bread and cayenne <i>wort</i>, in which, as usual, a fowl
had been boiled to rags, although Wallata Gabriel,
out of a tender regard for the conscience of her religious
old father, had fished up the bones with a
spoon, that he might suppose its rich consistence
depended only upon a thickening of meal.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>August 13th.</i>—Walderheros was occupied all day
splitting and reducing to proper dimensions the
ted tree that was brought yesterday, and of which
I had determined to manufacture an English chair.
Goodaloo was also busy, as he had undertaken to
make me a table, and which he managed to do
very well, after a long day’s labour. It consisted
merely of a round basket open at both extremities,
made by turning thin stripes of bamboo alternately,
before and behind strong upright pieces of the
same plant. This was completed by a top being
constructed of the like material, dexterously interwoven
upon a ray-like skeleton, which was afterwards
lashed tight down upon the basket pedestal
with thongs of raw hide, and in this manner an
excellent round table was made, three feet and
a-half in circumference, and more than a yard high.</p>

<p>I managed to put up a parchment window
during the day in the mud and stick wall, over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
where I intended the table should stand. Conveniently
to hand, when seated upon my intended
chair, I also placed against the wall, upon stick pegs
thrust through, a shelf of seven or eight short jowharee
stalks, so secured as to form a flat surface for
a few books to stand upon.</p>

<p>It was two days before I could manage the chair,
for I had neither hammer nor nails to work with,
only a small saw and a <i>matrabier</i>, or axe of
Abyssinia, and which is identically the same in
form as those used by the Dankalli. With these,
however, and a <i>medamager</i> heated red hot, with
which I burnt the holes in the frame, after some
little trouble, I built up by degrees a very respectable-looking
piece of furniture. Walderheros admired
it greatly, and soon interwove a very convenient
seat, with thongs of hide and a rope made of a long
kind of very tough grass, called <i>gwassia</i>, which
grows in the <i>daggan</i>, or high country, and is
largely used by the Abyssinians in making mats,
fining sieves for flour, and baskets.</p>

<p>When my new chair was placed in its situation
by the side of the table, a good light falling
through the parchment window, which I took care
to emblazon with sundry hieroglyphical and
heraldic devices, and my little library itself laden
with my books, I considered that I had a study
complete. On the partition behind the chair,
which separated my recess in the narrow corridor
between the two walls of my circular house, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
that occupied by the bedstead of Walderheros, I
put up a large map of Africa, whilst in the prolonged
sweep, on the other side of the table, was
contained my own bed, and although the greatest
width of the recess was scarcely five feet, altogether
when the arrangements were complete, I considered
my retreat to be very snug and comfortable.
All the portion of the inner wall of the house, in
front of my chair and table, was knocked down,
and being exactly opposite to the door, which was
again opposite to the little wicket of my garden
enclosure, not only was light admitted freely into
my study, but I always had a good view, from my
chair, of what was going on in the interior of my
house, and also of the neighbours who might be
passing down the lane, and who generally, whether
they saw me or not, bawled out the morning or
evening salutation.</p>

<p>I was now gradually becoming accustomed to
the circumstances of my situation, and began
to take more interest in observing man as I
found him in Shoa, but still I could not overcome
my disease, although for the sake of information,
I had called into my aid nearly all
native means and medicines. To-day some
pretenders to a mysterious kind of treatment
were introduced by Walderheros, with a strong
request that I should give them a trial, but on
understanding that they were professors of the
black art, and undertook to dislodge the <i>saroitsh</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
or demons, that afflicted me, I dismissed them
very summarily.</p>

<p>The popular belief in the existence of an inferior
order of bad spirits, is universal in Abyssinia, and
to their malign influence it is usual to ascribe
every disease incidental to the human frame.
Different opinions exist as to the number of these
“<i>saroitsh</i>” (<i>sar</i>, in the singular). Some affirm
there are only eight, others sixteen, and not a few
say as many as eighty. Christians, Mahomedans,
and Pagan Gallas, alike pay a kind of reverence to
these evil spirits, by observing customs to avert
the consequences of their anger, when supposed
likely to be excited. In England we do exactly
the same, when certain means are adopted to avert
what we term “bad luck.” I certainly believe
myself that the same idea of minor devils afflicting
man in some cases of ill health, was popular among
our immediate ancestors, and the fantastical names
that appear to have been bestowed upon them,
assimilates still more closely this popular superstition
of the Abyssinians of the present day, with
that of the inhabitants of England about the time
of Shakespear. Mad Tom, in “King Lear,”
affords some illustration of this, for we observe he
says of himself, “The foul fiend haunts poor Tom.
<i>Hop-dance</i> cries in Tom’s belly for two white
herrings.” From forgetfulness I neglected to note
down the names of the Abyssinian “saroitsh,”
for having one day inquired what they were,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
neither Walderheros nor his wife could recollect
more than six, and they could not vouch for the correctness
of these, so I was desired not to set them
down, as I should have a better opportunity of
acquiring them. After that it never occurred to
me, until it was too late, that I had not again
attended to the subject. One name, however, I
recollect, was “<i>Burr alunga</i>,” <i>silver whip</i>, and this
is somewhat of the same whimsical character as the
name of Hop-dance; and, in my opinion, future
inquiries will show a near approach in the nomenclature
of the two countries as regards this very
similar superstition. It must be also observed that
Mad Tom was afflicted with more than one, Frateretto,
Obidicut, Hobbididance, Mahu, Modo, and
Flibbertigibbet, being the several fiends whom we
are told tormented him.</p>

<p><i>August 14th.</i>—Walderheros seeing that I defied
the devil and all his works, by dismissing with a
suitable admonition his lying agents, tried then,
upon a different principle, to relieve me of the
fever, and brought me down this morning two
priests from the Church of Goodis Gorgis (St.
George), which is situated on the ridge in front of
Ankobar, before we come to the denuded site of
the old Church of Abbo. These turbaned ministers
of religion promised faithfully by prayers to
cure me of my harassing complaint. I shook my
head in a most scandalous manner, as I doubted the
efficacy of their intercession quite as much as I did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
that of the devil worshippers, but gave them the
salt notwithstanding, and after a long blessing,
which I thought would never have ended, these
two holy men took their leave.</p>

<p>When I was at Myolones, I heard that I was not
far distant from a “goodam,” or monastery of
Tabeebs. This is the name of the artificers of Shoa,
a blacksmith, a carpenter, a potter, a saddle-maker,
each being called “Tabeeb.” This has also become
proverbial to particularize a clever man by an
allusion to these cunning workmen, and I suspect
that ere long the Shoans will have no other word
for a sorcerer. I heard some remarkable tales
respecting them: that they lived in common, men
and women, but only met during the darkness
of night, and the consequence was, that the
greatest confusion of family and kindred ties
resulted. In the day time the sexes lived, I was
told, in separate houses. There was something
very mysterious about them, so I determined as
soon as the rains had subsided to visit one of their
“goodams” and judge for myself. Among other
things, it was said they were not Christians, and
yet worshipped God and believed in Christ; that
they had no “tabot,” and that all the men and
women were priests and priestesses. I could, in
fact, make nothing of them; sometimes I thought
they might be Jews, and then again that they were
Freemasons, whose orgies had here assumed a
religious character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
I had an opportunity during to-day of making
some inquiries; for one of the inmates of the
Tabeeb convent, near Myolones, called to ask me
for some medicine. He produced from beneath
his tobe a drinking-horn, very neatly made, which
he presented as his memolagee. After I had given
him what he required I got Walderheros to ask him
a few questions, and he seemed quite pleased that I
took an interest in the religious opinions of the sect.
He denied with a deal of indignation the common
rumour of the men and women living promiscuously;
on the contrary, he insisted that not only
did a breach of chastity exclude the parties from
the community, but no married people were
allowed to live among them. It is only in the
<i>Goodam</i>, or convent, this discipline is enforced,
for a Tabeeb can marry and live like the other
Shoans, but he then only visits the “Goodam,” of
his relations as a stranger until, tired of society,
disabled or old, when he can again claim admission
as a brother of their order. The Tabeebs are
Christians, but do not pray to the Virgin Mary,
and believe that Christ had no father, but still was
a man like ourselves. They have no “tabot,” or
moveable altar (an ark), like the other Christians
of Shoa, or as they would have, I suppose, if they
were Jews. Every day in the week, except
Saturday and Sunday, is a strict fast. They have
no bed to sleep upon, as they sit up all night in
their church, ranged along the wall, to which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
straps are secured, and within which the people
sit at prayers, so that should any one go to sleep,
he might not fall and hurt himself, or disturb the
others. The <i>Goodam</i> is divided into two portions,
one side being occupied with the women, the
other by the men, and no unnecessary communication
is permitted between the sexes. They eat and
drink together once a-day in the evening, each
having a fixed portion of food. The women grind
flour, and work as do other Shoan females; the
monks labour at the forge, or in the fields belonging
to their convent. The Tabeeb women also make
the earthenware vessels in the country, as all ironwork
is done by the men. There are two superiors,
an aged woman who has charge of the females, and
an old man placed in authority over the males.
The Negoos is a great friend to the Tabeebs, and
gives to them several oxen during the year. Besides
he has bestowed a great deal of land upon
the various monasteries of these people, of which
institutions there are no less than forty-two in
Shoa. When the good man left me, I gave him a
pair of scissors in return for his drinking horn, as I
now made it a rule not to receive any memolagees.
He was so delighted with my gift, that he pressed
me very much to come and see him at his convent,
as soon as ever I dared to move about, and
promised me a very good reception.</p>

<p>The Abyssinians in making their drinking-horns,
show considerable ingenuity, not so much in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
complexity of their machinery, as in the great
simplicity of the few aids they require to turn out
a very neatly made article. A proper ox-horn
being selected, it is cut into such lengths as are
required. One of these is then gradually fixed
upon a conical wooden mould; boiling water being
employed to soften the horn, and make it more
readily adapt itself to the shape, it is then laid
aside for a few days, when the form becoming fixed,
it is placed in the lathe to receive a series of
circular cut rings, with which the outside is usually
ornamented.</p>

<p>The lathe is nothing more than two short sticks
placed in the ground, not more than three inches
high above its surface. From the centre of each
end of the mould an arm projects about six
inches long, which is armed with a bit of iron.
These iron points are received in the short stick
supports, and the mould, with the horn upon it,
then revolves freely. The workman sits upon the
ground, and with his feet pressed hard against a
stick, supports it in this manner against two stones,
placed at a convenient distance in front of his work.
This forms a rest for his cutting instrument, which
he holds in his left hand, and presses against the
horn, whilst with his right he wheels backwards and
forwards the mould by a small catgut string bow,
applied and used in the same manner as is the
same tool by many artisans in England.</p>

<p>Not only are drinking-horns thus fashioned (and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
which, I must observe, are finished by a piece of
round wood being fitted like a thin cork into the
lower and smaller end), but also earrings are turned
from the long black horn of the <i>sala</i>, a species of
antelope, common in Adal and the low countries
around Abyssinia. The solid extremities of the
horns only are used, so that not more than two
pair of earrings can be made from one horn, which
is at least two feet long. The earrings are large
and clumsy, but, considering the simple means employed
in making them, are not despicable works
of art. Each is turned in two pieces, not at all
unlike in form and size high convex buttons, with
small straight shafts projecting from the inside
centres. These shafts are made so that one receives
the other, and the earring thus formed looks
like two small wheels connected by a short axle.
To receive them into the ear a very large hole is
required, and the axis of one of the halves being
first introduced, the other is fixed upon it, and the
lady then turns round, to ask how the new ornament
looks.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have seen these horn earrings ornamented
with an inlaid star of silver, and many an
hour’s labour have I had myself, letting in little
brass studs from an old box-lid into the surface in
the same manner, to please some of my female
friends, who would come begging to have their
earrings thus improved in appearance. Besides
these ornaments turned from the sala horn, small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
black rings are cut, and I have also seen a neat
little bottle, about two inches long, turned in a
very ingenious manner, and which was intended to
hold “col” (the black oxide of antimony), with
which the Mahomedans adorn their eyelids, and the
Christians employ as a medicine, applying it in the
same manner. Besides horn earrings, the Abyssinian
women wear large silver ones, sometimes
weighing as much as two or three dollars each.
One fashion alone is general in Shoa, a back and
front portion, each of which invariably consists of
three large beads, surmounted by a fourth. These
are fixed in the ear in a similar manner as the horn
ones, and look not unlike small bunches of grapes
projecting before and behind.</p>

<p>Whilst I am upon this subject, I may observe
that the Shoan women are exceedingly fond of
silver ornaments, and all their riches consist of such
stores. Dollars are only valued as the means of
thus enabling the possessors to adorn themselves or
their women, for all the coin of this sort which
enters Shoa ultimately finds its way into the
crucible, except such as falls into the hands of the
King, and which are destined for a less useful end,
these being securely packed in jars, and deposited
in caves. One hill, called Kundi, a few miles to
the north of Ankobar, is pierced by numerous subterranean
passages, in which are hidden in this
manner immense treasures in gold and silver.
They are kept closed by heavy doors of iron, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
the whole hill, which is surmounted by a church,
dedicated to the Virgin, is under the care of a vast
number of priests. I think it not improbable that
some excavated chambers that have been found in
Egypt, and in rocks near Jerusalem, and considered
to have been intended for tombs, were in fact the
treasuries of the monarchs of these countries.</p>

<p>One ornament of silver, and which is worn by
the women of Shoa upon the breast, hanging from
the neck by a chain, also of silver, is in the form of
a clasp, three or four inches long, and one inch
broad; upon its front surface not unfrequently is
rudely engraved some simple design in waving
lines. Bracelets of silver are sometimes seen, and
with the Mahomedan women, they are invariably of
that metal; but the Christians generally wear plain
ones, made of pewter, with anklets to correspond.</p>

<p>Besides the little unpretending martab of blue
silk, the Christian women, if they can afford it, wear
large necklaces of beads, and the British Political
Mission have greatly increased the stock of these
ornaments that is now brought into the market.
Those I have seen were made generally by a succession
of loops, consisting of seven or eight threads
of different coloured seed beads, collected at certain
lengths into one string, through a large angular-cut
piece of amber. Eight or ten of these loops formed a
long negligee, which, ornamented with a large tassel
of small beads, was a present suited even for the acceptance
of royalty. The Mahomedan women, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
the contrary, wear one string of beads around their
necks, formed of a hundred large and differently
coloured beads, among which bright red ones seem
to be preferred. These are divided into lengths
by the interposition of pieces of amber, at least
twice as long as those employed by the Christian
women in collecting together into one, the various
bead threads of their necklaces. The silver bracelets
of the Islam are also different in form from
those worn by the Christians, consisting of two or
three thick silver wires, twisted upon each other,
and finished at each extremity by a beaten square
head. This is looped around the wrist, where it
remains until required as security for loans, the
most important use, I think, of silver articles in
Shoa, amongst all religious denominations. No
golden ornaments are ever observed among the
Shoans, for a sumptuary edict of the Negoos forbids
his subjects the use of this metal; the royal
family of course being excepted.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>August 14th.</i>—Wallata Gabriel was a very good
housekeeper, but unfortunately, like most other
young women in Shoa, and, I believe, in all Abyssinia,
she had a great many followers. Whenever
Walderheros and I walked out, some one or other
would always be manœuvring to get out of the house
unobserved on our return; and although I was
rather suspicious of some of her lovers making free
with what little property I had, still I had as yet
never missed anything. I had frequently reminded
Walderheros of this weakness in his wife, but he
always, in reply, appealed to me if she was not a
good servant, although, he added, that it was
for my convenience that he recognised her as his
wife, and would previously have divorced her, only
he thought that together they were so well
adapted to manage my domestic affairs, that he
could not do better than keep her. Coming in
rather inopportunely this afternoon, after a long
walk round the town, I could do nothing else but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
turn her away at once; whilst Walderheros expostulated
with her paramour, among other severe
things, asking him if he were not ashamed to
intrude in such a manner when the <i>balla bait</i> (the
master of the house) was not at home.</p>

<p>About an hour after I had dismissed Wallata
Gabriel, an old lady, a relation of Walderheros,
made her appearance, bringing some of the sweetly-scented
herb called <i>Err-guftah</i>, as a memolagee.
On requesting to know what she required, a long
apologizing palliating intercession, of no ordinary
character, was made for my delinquent housekeeper.
She attributed my severity, she said,
entirely to my not knowing Abyssinian customs,
and turning to Walderheros, who sat on the raised
rim of the hearth, stirring up the dry ashes with
a stick, she upbraided him for not raising his
voice in the behalf of his lawful wife. I was
determined she should not return, and was dismissing
the mediatrix with a positive refusal, when
Walderheros looked at me with a most grievous
expression of countenance, and lifted up the top of
the straw bread-basket, to intimate, by its empty
condition, how badly we should be off for dinner
if I persisted in not recalling his wife. I could
not help smiling, and the old lady, seeing me
relent, put her head out of the door, and called out
“Wallata Gabriel!” two or three times. The <em>fair
penitent</em> very soon appeared, for she had been sitting
in the lane all the time, and came tripping in,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
laughing and looking quite happy at being reinstated,
and without the least trace of sorrow or
contrition in her countenance.</p>

<p>This apparent lack of morality amongst the
Shoans, like their Church history, is quite beyond
my understanding. Yet even as respects this,
a person educated in the more correct principles of
what is considered to constitute social happiness,
does not perceive in Shoa that violence done to
propriety, which similar conduct in many of
the southern states in Europe is apt to excite.
The loose habits and indiscriminate intrigue,
which displeased me when I witnessed it among
the inhabitants of various countries situated
upon the northern shores of the Mediterranean,
only occasioned a smile when I observed it in
Abyssinia. Among the former it was the pretension
and affectation of virtue that made their sins
stand in bolder comparison as vices, than a somewhat
similar course of conduct among the simple, good-natured
inhabitants of the latter country, who have
no public opinion to propitiate, or, on the other
hand, to control them, and whose naturally yielding
disposition renders them too prone to indulgence;
where also, let it be recollected, religion applies no
curb, for the priests themselves in Shoa have had
the decency to cease preaching that, which they
never pretend to practise.</p>

<p>I was not many weeks upon the banks of the
Ganges, and had not many opportunities of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
observing the native population of India, but the
impression upon my mind of the moral character
of the people generally of that country, apart from
their particular worship, is, that the Indians,
especially the women, possess in a great degree
that moral principle, that delicacy of the mind,
which is essentially the basis of that high sense of
honour and personal respect, which constitute
female chastity. I was enabled to draw, by my
visit to India, a very interesting contrast between
the women of that country and those of Shoa.
Let me compare two extreme specimens, which
will illustrate more broadly that which I wish to
establish; that important differences in the constitution
of the mind are the primary causes of those
varieties in human nature; but which have been
previously determined by differences in the features
and form. This comparison will assist me, as truth,
I think, is sometimes strikingly demonstrated by
widely different contrasts; the paradox surprises
and amuses the mind, and its effect in consequence
is more permanent.</p>

<p>We will first, however, cursorily allude to the
physical differences between the Indian girl and
the Abyssinian, as a kind of introduction to their
habits. The former is tall, thin, long-waisted,
with an angular configuration of form, her features
regular, sharply defined, bright and placid. She
is a Circassian with a dark skin. Turn to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Abyssinian beauty, her eyes smile uncontrollably
as you look. Her figure is short, plump, and
roundly formed, with small, but full voluptuous
features, that appear blended together with an
infantile expression.</p>

<p>The minds of both are uneducated and natural: in
this circumstance of their character, fortunately for
the effect of the comparison, they may be supposed
to be alike. But are their dispositions or conduct
the same? How very different. The Indian girl has
considerable personal vanity, is fond of ornaments
and show, and seeks to attract attention by rich
clothes, or studied graces. Even in their national
attitudinizing, and the alluring nautch, repose and
quiet seem to distinguish her from the laughing,
romping, dress-neglecting Abyssinian, who, to
attract notice, affects the child, and endeavours to
please by artlessness and simplicity. As lovers, the
Indian girl capriciously selects one lord, but the
Abyssinian would consider this to be petty treason
against nature, and a crying sin; she always loves
the nearest, and whilst the eyes of that one are
upon her, is reluctantly constant, but considers all
engagements quite at end by absence, however short.
Our coquettes, tall girls, with thin lips and cold
sparkling eyes, always remind me of the Indian
beauty, whilst our laughter-loving romps, even in
their features and form, seem to belong to the
Abyssinian mould, in some measure demonstrating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
the solution of the difficult problem, of accounting
for the origin of those differences in the several varieties
into which ethnologists have divided mankind.
Among our own acquaintances, under external circumstances,
exactly alike, nature produces by the
mysterious agency of mental endowments, the possible
mothers of families of man, which, under
different circumstances of situation and of social
education, would ultimately present two nations as
distinct in every phenomenon of external appearance
as are the most opposed specimens of the Circassian
or the negro type.</p>

<p>The Shoans are certainly not a virtuous people,
according to our ideas, and if we are to judge them
by the standard of our moral code; but I positively
deny that they are an immodest people, except
among those where the dehumanizing influence of
Mahomedanism, by degrading woman to the condition
of a slave, has engendered the disgusting sensuality
which characterizes the professors of that
religion, and even these in Abyssinia are as superior
as possible in this respect to the Mahomedans of
Arabia and Persia. My opinion as to the modesty
of the Shoan women may not perhaps be sufficiently
understood, to be considered correct; but it
was formed by observing the freedom from all restraint
which they appear to enjoy in their country
and among their families. This implies some
confidence on the part of the men, and a woman
must be modest to the extent that society requires,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
to command such a mark of deference and respect
from the opposite sex.</p>

<p>I have seen sufficient, indeed, to convince me
that the youth of Abyssinia, males and females,
whilst influenced by the feelings natural to that
age, are diffident, confiding, and good-natured,
and however they may become altered by the
experience of increasing years, and the education
of after life, these moral principles still prevail, and
give a favourable inclination to the practice of virtue
and justice, that renders their social condition productive
of much happiness to themselves, and affords
some pleasure to the mind, that contemplates their
character and condition, uninfluenced by the bias
derived from the moral discipline of a very differently
constituted community.</p>

<p><i>August 15th.</i>—Being unable to go much abroad
to extend my acquaintance with the habits and
manners of the Shoans, I was particularly desirous
that my establishment should be entirely conducted
upon the principles of Abyssinian domestic economy.
As this exactly suited the inclination of
Walderheros, and as it did not matter to Goodaloo
in what way things were managed, so that he got a
large roll of teff bread in a morning to wrap up in
his mekanet when he went to cut fuel, and his
supper in the evening when he re turned, the proposal
met with universal approbation from the
members of my household, and my wishes were
attended to in every particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
Among other employments that occupied Walderheros
and his wife two or three days every
fortnight, was that of brewing, which was no
trifling affair, as a fresh jar of ale, holding at least
four gallons, was broached every day. The process
is simple enough as performed in Shoa, and
instead of being obliged to stand some time after
it is made, five or six days is the time that is
required to ripen and fine the beverage, which, if
made well, is agreeable and very strong, with a
slight acidity, that reminded me of the oldest ale I
had ever drunk in England.</p>

<p>The ingredients are various, sometimes wheat or
barley, or jowarhee grain, but in the kolla or low
countries the latter is preferred, and as I also
found some useful medical effects resulting from
its use, my ale most frequently was made from this
grain. The jowarhee is the durra of the Arabs, and
is largely grown in India, where I think English
residents might, by following the Abyssinian method,
always have home-brewed ale in their houses.</p>

<p>When barley is employed for the purpose of
brewing, it is first well dried in the sun, and afterwards
broken in a mortar to divest it in some measure
from the coarse outer skin, and which is
separated by the usual process of fining through a
grass made sieve. The prepared grain is then
placed in a large earthenware saucer, at least two
feet in diameter, and in the centre about six inches
deep. This being raised upon three supports over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
a low fire, an attendant keeps stirring the contents,
using for this purpose the small reaping hook of
the country, the convex curve of which scrapes the
barley from the bottom of the saucer, and prevents
its burning. Whilst this is going on, another
servant washes the jars intended to receive the ale,
and which, after being well rinsed out, are fumigated
by a few leaves of the bitter <i>gaisho</i> plant,
placed upon a little lighted charcoal, on a broken
piece of earthenware, and is introduced beneath
the mouth of the vessel, which is held over it to
receive the ascending smoke.</p>

<p><i>Gaisho</i> are the leaves of a species of <i>Rhamnus</i>
indigenous to Shoa, for besides being regularly
cultivated in favourable situations between six to
eight thousand feet above the level of the sea, I
have also found it growing wild at the base of the
hill of Kundi, above the Tabeeb monastery, in that
neighbourhood. These leaves are serrated, and of
the form and size of bay leaves, only of a lighter
green. When used, after being dried in the sun,
they are pulverized in a mortar until a very fine
powder of an intensely but not permanent bitter is
produced. It is then ready for the purposes required,
which are similar to those of hops and
gentian in brewing our beer.</p>

<p>After the barley has been well roasted, it is
taken out of the pan and ground into a coarse meal,
which, after being slightly wetted with water, is
again exposed to the action of heat in the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
manner as before, until it has become thoroughly
scorched; being kept the whole time well stirred to
prevent its burning. During this process, a small
jar containing a thin acid mixture of flour and
water, called <i>wahaka</i>, or leaven, to which the powdered
<i>gaisho</i> has been previously added, has been
standing to infuse in the warm wood ashes. The
meal being now removed from the fire, is put into
another jar, and sufficient water being added to
make it into a paste, the <i>wahaka</i> is also added, and
the mixture remains for the rest of the day. On
the morrow, the whole contents of the lesser jar are
transferred into one much larger, capable of holding
at least thirty gallons of water, and which is now
brought and poured by successive jarsfull into it until
full. This is allowed to stand another day, when
the surface, showing evidences of a certain point in
the process of fermentation having been attained,
the whole is then decanted, and strained through a
large straw funnel into a number of lesser jars, each
of which contains from four to five gallons. These
are carefully stoppered by large cakes of a dirty
mixture of the refuse of the strainings of the large
jar and of clay, and which are plastered over the
mouths of the jars. In about three days the ale is
ready for use, and if made properly, is most
excellent; bright, sparkling, and potent, it reminded
me, by a slight acidity, of the best
October of England. After nine or ten days,
Abyssinian ale gets too sour to be a pleasant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
draught, which I attribute to the imperfect covering
afforded by the clay plasters which close the jars in
which it is contained.</p>

<p>When jowarhee, or durra is used, the grain,
after being reduced to a fine meal, is made into a
paste, or rather thin batter, with the <i>wahaka</i>.
After standing one day and night, it is then made
into thin cakes, as in the usual manner of baking
teff bread. These cakes are afterwards broken up
and placed in the large jar, the gaisho and water
being added exactly as in the process where barley
is employed, and when fermentation has somewhat
progressed, the wort is in the same manner strained
and decanted into lesser jars.</p>

<p>There is a red variety of jowarhee, or millet,
called <i>tallange</i> largely cultivated in Shoa for brewing
the tallah alone, as it is considered to produce
the best description of the beverage. It is said to
be injurious to man eaten in the form of <i>nuffrau</i>,
or bread, although the grain is given to cattle for
food. This certainly makes very fine ale, and should
the experiment of making jowarhee beer succeed
in the East, where I hope it will be tried, it will be
very easy to procure some <i>tallange</i> for seed from
Abyssinia, should the plant not exist, as I do not
expect it does at present, in India.</p>

<p>In conjunction with all these different grains, and
with a mixture of all, which is sometimes employed
in the same brewing, it is not unusual to add a little
real malt called <i>bikkalo</i>, generally in the proportion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
of double the quantity of gaisho. To make
the bikkalo, a quantity of barley is placed in a flat
dish and well wetted with water, a large stone
being placed upon it. This presses the sprouting
grain into one mass of a wheel-like form, which,
when the operation has proceeded as far as is
desired, is taken from the dish, a hole made
through the centre, and it is strung upon a rope,
where it hangs to dry against the wall, and is
a common ornament of the interior of the houses
in Shoa. On occasions of brewing, the quantity
required is broken off, and its value as an ingredient
is well-known, for a common Shoan proverb says,
“the more bikkalo the better ale.”</p>

<p>The proportions of the different ingredients are
generally from forty to fifty pounds of grain, to
which is added one pound of <i>gaisho</i>, and two
pounds of <i>bikkalo</i>. From these quantities are
made about thirty gallons of very good beer, but
which, as I have observed before, will not keep
more than ten or twelve days, which is one reason
why ale is brewed generally in such small
quantities.</p>

<p>There is no beverage so largely indulged in by
the Shoans, whether Christian or Islam, as tallah.
The Hurrahgee people are also extremely addicted
to drinking it, and when they arrive in the country,
every saltpiece that they can get is sure to be
spent in ale. It is, therefore, an essential on all
occasions of rejoicings, whether of a religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
character, or at weddings, and even at <em>funerals</em>.
In fact, the number and size of the jars of ale
provided for the company indicates the importance
of the feast, or the wealth of the entertainer, whilst
no one to whom the cornucopœia of ancient
mythology is familiar, but detects at once, the
origin of that poetical appendage to divinity, as he
contemplates the parties engaged in celebrating
these jovial meetings. Every one bearing in his
hand, a deep drinking-horn, varying in length,
from a long span to more than half a cubit, which,
as he drains its contents, is handed to the servants in
charge of the jars of tallah, who quickly replenish
it, and return it to the thirsty soul. Each reveller
keeps to his own rude flagon, and nothing could
more strikingly typify agricultural wealth and
rustic happiness, than the representation of one of
these drinking horns; and which, ornamented and
embellished by Grecian and Latin poets, still I
believe to have been the original of the famous
horn of plenty; probably derived from some
Egyptian hieroglyphic, which well expressed the condition
of man it appears so naturally to characterize.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>August 16th.</i>—Ibrahim, the retired slave-merchant,
who had not called since I had made the improvements
in my house, came in to-day. He was rather
astonished at the transformation I had effected,
gave the table a good shake, sat down in my chair,
and <i>tabored</i> with his fingers against the parchment
window. “<i>Ahkeem e moot</i>,” said he at last, “may
the doctor die! if it is not good; you are a <i>tabeeb</i>, and
the house of your Queen is not furnished so well.”
The old gentleman had brought his work with
him, a piece of blue sood, which he was embroidering
with green and red silk in a large cross-bar
pattern, and which he told me was intended for a
holiday guftah for his wife. Here I must observe,
that although the Islam women in Shoa usually
wear clothes of some common material dyed red,
upon festival days they display very rich headdresses
of foreign silk, or embroidered cotton cloth,
such as Ibrahim was now working.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
Walderheros placed the low Abyssinian chair for
his accommodation, and then, as was generally the
case when Ibrahim came to see me, a long conversation
commenced respecting the town of Hurrah,
of which he was a native, although he had not
been to that city for the last eight or nine years.
As usual, we had a map sketched upon the floor
before us, which, however, on this occasion was not
a very complicated one, merely the southern portion
of the Hawash, where it encircles Shoa, and which
formed the conclusion of the course of that river, the
northern portion of which, as far as the ford of Mulkakuyu,
I had already received information of from
my Dankalli friends, Ohmed Medina and Ohmedu.</p>

<p>The principal features of the geography of the
country included in the sketch map, were the three
principal streams entering the Hawash from the
scarp of the Abyssinian table-land, all of which
flowed nearly to the south; but the most remarkable
and interesting one was the great indentation in
the outline of the high country, which in this situation
seemed to be approaching to a separation into
two parts by the denudation of the sources of the
Hawash on the east, and a corresponding degradation
on the west, occasioned by the action of the
waters of the Assabi, or Abiah, the red Nile falling
from the elevated plains of its earlier tributaries to
join the Bahr ul Abiad at Kartoom, where its
height above the level of the sea does not, I believe,
exceed three thousand feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Surrounding the head of the Hawash, separated
only by the narrow valleys of denudation around its
sources, are three elevated countries, all forming
part of the table-land of Abyssinia, and between
which, in the course of ages, this river has intruded
itself by slow degrees, and is still progressing annually
farther to the west. These three countries are
Zingero to the south, Enarea to the west, and Shoa
to the north, whilst the corresponding portions of
the scarp are Gurague, Maitcha, and the ancient
province of Fatagar, the more westerly portion of
which is now possessed by the Soddo Gallas.</p>

<p>This now excavated portion of Abyssinia must
have been at a former period one continuous
table land, and the countries of Zingero and of
Shoa then could only have been separated by
streams that flowed to the north into the Abi,
or to the south into the Gibbee, the ancient
Assabi. The same convulsion which has determined
the peculiar course of the Abi, or Bruce’s
Nile, seems to have influenced the direction of the
encroachment of the Hawash into the limits of the
plateau of Abyssinia; and also the position of the
débouché of the Red Nile from its summit to the
plains below. An examination of the map will
show a curious correspondence between the situation
of the sources of the Hawash, of the southern
curve of the Abi, and of the break in the table
land where that river joins the Red Nile near Fazuglo.
A great geological fault seems to extend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
across Abyssinia in the direction of these several
points, one effect of which (that of the great disintegration
of the material of the rocks along its course)
appears to me to have favoured the denudation
observed on the eastern and western borders of
this country. To this fracture I also attribute
the sudden curve of the Abi to the west, after
flowing nearly due south from lake Dembea; the
physical barrier to its farther continuance in that
direction not being a ridge of hills, or what is
generally termed an anticlinal axis, but the presence
of the opposite wall of the disjointed rock, which
characterizes the extension of the fault across the
table land. This is neither unfounded assertion
nor rash conclusion, but the deliberate opinion I
have formed by a careful examination of the
mighty operations of nature that appear to have
acted upon the surface geography of Abyssinia from
the most remote ages.</p>

<p>Let my reader return with me for a moment to
the country of Adal, an extensive plain, scarcely
one thousand feet high above the level of the sea.
Its river, the Hawash, peculiarly its own, distinct in
the non-existence of opposite corresponding water-sheds
to identify it as having formed part of the
original surface level of the surrounding countries:
an intruder, in fact, between the opposite slopes of
the river Tacazza to the north and of the river
Whabbee to the south; the countries of which
were once continuous, but some convulsion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
connected probably with that which has occasioned
the fault across the table land of Abyssinia,
has in this position, severed the country completely;
and in the gaping chasm, filled up to a
certain level with the debris, has formed the bed
of the Hawash, which gradually progressing on
every side, its wide circumference of sources encroaches
every year upon the elevated lands which
surround it.</p>

<p>A traveller in Adal cannot help noticing the
singular character of the situation of the river
Hawash, for he crosses over its bounding ridge to
the east, and has partial opportunities of observing
the bluff scarp-like terminations of the Angotcha,
the Abyssinian, and the Hurrahgee table lands,
all of which are being rapidly denuded by the
numerous little tributaries which flow to swell the
Hawash. But this extending operation is most
strikingly illustrated in a line with the fault which
has extended from the sea-coast to Fazuglo, in the
west of Abyssinia. Here, to the south of Shoa,
the Hawash has already approached within one
day’s journey from the deep valley of the Abi, and
removes annually great portions of the surrounding
table land, which had previously determined the
rain drops to flow into that river, but subsequent
to which removal, all falling water must for the
future, aid in swelling the insidious river of the
low-land of Adal. The valleys of numerous
small streams, the sides of which, denuded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
to the required depth, have been thus gradually
opened into, and as this is naturally aided by the
steep fall of the scarp, denudation goes on rapidly
when the first inclination towards the Hawash has
been given to the stream, that had previously
meandered upon a nearly level plain. In this
manner I contend, that the valley of the Airahra,
between the narrow ridges of Ankobar, and the
edge of the table-land at Tchakkah, has been
acted upon, and that the waters falling to the west
of Ankobar, and which now flow into the Hawash,
were formerly conducted to the Jumma, and so to
the Abi, when the two elevated points mentioned
were continuous, as they most certainly have been.</p>

<p>The geology of Abyssinia also favours these
strange alterations of its own face; for it is
composed almost entirely of volcanic rocks, easily
decomposable, the operation, in fact, scarcely
requires the aid of water to occasion it; for the
atmosphere alone crumbles the hardest rocks, in
the course of one year, into a stratum of loose earth;
and water appears to be merely the carrying agent,
to remove the soft soil, and expose a fresh surface
to the action of the air. It is this which adds so
considerably to the fertility of the Argobbah
counties, situated on the scarp of the Abyssinian
table-land; for every fresh year, virgin earth of the
most fertile capability, is offered spontaneously,
for the benefit of the cultivator, to whom, in this
situation, the use of manure is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
Rain, however, aids considerably in removing
vast portions of the table-land; for during the wet
season, generally some few days after the commencement
of the rains, and again, near its close,
severe thunder storms, with slight earthquakes,
occur; and the devastation which results, is not so
much to be attributed to the latter, as it is to the
previously fallen rain; which, having penetrated to
a certain depth of the easily disintegrated rock,
the least agitation brings down immense quantities,
from the nearly perpendicular cliffs. An earthquake
scarcely perceptible, and which, perhaps, is
only consequent upon meteoric explosion, by the
reverberating vibrations being communicated to the
loose, yet prominent surfaces of the hilly scarp; there
always precipitates ruinous masses of earth and rock,
whilst not a trace of its effects can be perceived upon
the table-land. This is the real character of all
earthquakes in Abyssinia I have witnessed; and
although the death of twelve or fifteen people, have
been consequent, it has only been in different
situations of peril, the proper precaution could
have easily obviated, as it was where denudation
had been long undermining the foundation
of their houses, or of those on the terraces above;
and which, when a moment of extraordinary atmospheric
commotion occurred, were shaken from the
sides of the valleys into the stream below. No
leaping of the earth, or those violent commotions,
which mark these convulsions in other countries,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
occur in Shoa. In Ankobar, during the severest
landslips, for they are nothing else, a loose stone
building thirty or forty feet high, and a still more
rickety arch built by Demetrius, although in
exposed situations, were not affected in the least.</p>

<p>The tremour of the earth consequent upon
portions of its surface being detached, was only felt
upon the situation on which it occurred; and were
it not for the heavy fall of rocks from the overhanging
table-land, no evidences of a violent
convulsion could be ever observed; so that I am
justified, in attributing to external influences,
rather than to internal operations, the occasional
agitations of the earth which are experienced in
Abyssinia during the wet season.</p>

<p>The combined effects, however, of all these disintegrating
agents of the table land of Abyssinia, is to
increase farther westward the course of the Hawash,
and we find that in the situation most favourable
for the operation of denudation there is contained,
its most distant sources. Already, by the testimony
of M. Rochet d’Hericourt and Dr. Krapf,
the head of the Hawash reaches within thirty
miles of the Abi, the Nile of Bruce, and that in that
direction it will still progress, may be safely assumed,
whilst the present order of things established by
nature is continued; and in the course of time a
communication will most certainly be opened
between this river and that of Northern Abyssinia,
when probably, by this addition to its volume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
of water, and a continual denudation going on
also towards the east, diminishing daily the barrier
between it and the sea; the Hawash will then enter
the sea, and open a fresh highway into the interior
of Africa. Geologists may observe in this mighty
operation, something analogous to that to which they
attribute other natural phenomena with which they
may be familiar, and the facts that I have stated, singular
as they may appear, are as easily demonstrated
to be true as is the westward progress of the falls of
Niagara towards the lakes of Northern America.</p>

<p>Within the indentation in the table land to
the south of Shoa, Ibrahim placed three principal
streams, all of which appear to flow south from the
scarp in that situation. These were, one stream
which separated the Maitcha Gallas from the Soddo
Gallas; the second, called Hashei, which separated
the latter from the Abitshoo; and the third was
the Kassam, which flowed through the province of
Bulga. On inquiring the situation of the Zui lake,
which, from previous information, I knew was not
far from the Hawash in this situation, Ibrahim
explained to me that it received the waters that
flowed from the opposite scarp to that of Shoa,
and which constituted, with the high land to the
north of the Gibbee in this situation, the country
of Gurague. On the other side of the stream of
the Gibbee was Zingero. Zui, called also Lakee,
has several small islands situated in its waters,
each of which is inhabited by monks, but on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
largest a very celebrated monastery exists, in
which, according to vulgar ideas, all the wealth
and books relative to the ancient empire of Abyssinia
have been concealed since the celebrated Mahomedan
invasion of that country in the sixteenth
century, by Mahomed Grahnè. There may be some
truth respecting the manuscripts that are contained
in the monastery of Lake Zui, but I question much
if any treasure is to be found there, for in that case
Sahale Selassee would, before this, have attempted
to subdue the Galla tribes intervening, which could
be accomplished in one campaign, for already, in
that direction, the country as far as the Hawash
has submitted to him, and Zui is not more than
two days’ journey to the south. That its conquest
is intended by the Negoos of Shoa, I have no doubt,
and I think he only postpones it until he can effect
the reduction of the whole of Gurague, at the same
time the inhabitants of which are very much affected
towards him, and in fact consider him to be their
monarch. I have witnessed two or three interesting
interviews between parties coming with
unsolicited tribute from Gurague; and when the
monarch endeavoured to induce me to remain with
him, he held out the opportunity I should have of
visiting that country in the course of the next two
years, by accompanying him, and which he supposed
would be a temptation for me to stay.</p>

<p>The Negoos himself corroborated the statement
of Ibrahim, who had visited the shores of this lake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
several times, that there was no outlet for its waters,
but that it was entirely distinct from the river
Hawash. Karissa, a Galla, from Cambat, who
when enslaved was first taken to Gurague, and lived
near Zui several years, also told me that a number
of small streams fell into the lake from all sides
and that there was a tradition that a long time ago,
the length of which he had no idea of, all the
country now occupied by the lake which is about
fifteen miles in diameter, was possessed by seven
chiefs, whose lands, for their sins, of course, or it
would not be an Abyssinian legend, were swallowed
up in one night, with loud subterranean noises, and
stars shooting out of the earth, and that the next
day nothing could be seen but the present lakes,
and the islands it contains. Considering the character
of the country, and the phenomena still witnessed
in Adal, whilst the country around Zui
appears to be situated upon the same elevation
above the sea; I have no doubt that this tradition is
partly founded upon fact, and contains the national
remembrance of an extensive and appalling incident
connected with some volcanic convulsion, that
at a former period occurred in this situation.</p>

<p>My morning’s lesson in geography terminated with
a promise that Ibrahim should get me the title of
a Geez book upon the subject, which he asserted
he had seen in Hurrah, for I must observe he ridiculed
the idea of anything having been preserved
during the invasion of Grahnè into Abyssinia, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
being taken to the monastery of Zui. He stated that
in the city of Hurrah, which was then the capital
of the kingdom of Adal, there was at the present
day an entire library which had formed part of the
spoil of the conqueror on that occasion, and that in
the same building with the books is preserved the
original silver kettle drums that were formerly
carried before the Emperor. He had also seen a
map which had been made by the orders of Mahomed
Grahnè, of the countries he had subdued
from Massoah and Gondah in the north, to Magadish
in the south, and upon which was particularly
marked the site of every Christian temple he had
destroyed. A copy of this map could, I think, be
easily obtained by means of our Berberah acquaintance,
Shurmalkee, whose connexion with the city
of Hurrah is much more considerable than it is
supposed to be by our Government.</p>

<p>Upon both banks of that part of the Hawash
which partially encircles Shoa, numerous tribes of
Galla find sustenance for immense herds of cattle.
Among these, the most important are the Maitcha
and Soddo tribes, situated upon the earliest of its
most western tributaries; next to these, proceeding
from the west, is the Tchukalla; then Lakee, or those
living between lake Zui and the Hawash; to these
succeed the Gilla, the Roga, and then the Gallahn,
the chief of which, Shumbo, is a son-in-law of the
Negoos, baptized and married the same day, whilst
I was in Shoa. Through his district lies the safest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
road to Gurague, and accordingly it is the one
principally taken by slave merchants, who, however,
seldom return that way, preferring a more
circuitous one, around the sources of the Hawash,
among the tribes situated upon the table land of
Abyssinia. Adjoining to the Gallahn Galla are
the Aroosee, a powerful and warlike nation of the
same people, but who appear to be considerably in
advance of their barbarous brethren. The Aroosee
are large agriculturists, and great quantities of
coffee, and of a red dye, called <i>wurrsee</i>, which is
exported from Berberah to India and Arabia, is
produced in their country. They occupy all the
district between Hawash and the north-western
streams of the Whabbee. Where they terminate
on the east, the possessions of the Hittoo Galla commence,
who also “drink of the waters of the Hawash,”
and are, it will be recollected the tribe, some of
whom attacked the Kafilah of the Hy Soumaulee, at
Dophan, on the occasion of my coming up to Shoa.
On a map of a limited size, it would be impossible
to introduce the names of the numerous tribes of
these people that border upon Shoa to the south,
nor would any benefit arise from the list beyond
that which may be obtained by the general designation,
“Galla tribes,” and which I have, therefore,
employed to mark the localities of these people.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>August 21st.</i>—The termination of the fast of Felsat
was hailed with considerable pleasure by the very
best of Christians in Shoa, and this happened on
the last day of the interval which dates this
chapter, for increasing want of space compels me
to relinquish the usual diurnal account. As it
happened, nothing of importance occurred, except
only that I began to find myself gradually getting
weaker and weaker, and the symptoms of my illness
increasing in violence upon every fresh attack.
I attributed this, in a great measure, to the wet
season, which was now most decidedly set in, and
for the last three or four days especially it had
rained without intermission. It was a cheerless
time, the moist foggy state of the atmosphere, and
the muddy condition of the road, quite prevented
me from taking my usual walks, and looking at
the dripping state of my thatched roof, or listening
to the pattering of the large rain drops against my
parchment window, was all the amusement I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
after I had determined to confine myself more to
bed, either to recruit myself after the severe fever
paroxysms, or with the hope of averting in some
measure the force of their attack by a little careful
nursing. I ceased, too, to take any pleasure in
the interesting conversations of Ibrahim, or Sheik
Tigh, or, in fact, any one from whom previously I
had ever been most inquiring respecting every
subject of importance or novelty I could think of
to ask about. My cup of coffee in the morning, or
a drinking hornful of the warmed ale, was the
only thing I dare indulge in, for solids of any kind
had a great tendency to occasion congestion in the
brain, and after eating anything a severe headache
was the certain consequence. I took the hint, and
gave up the honeyed repast at breakfast and the
fricassee at night, and made a point of conciliating
as much as possible that irritable viscus the
stomach, that seemed after all to be at the bottom
of the evil.</p>

<p>It was a horrible retribution, therefore, for Walderheros
to contemplate, and which, no doubt, will
have a beneficial effect upon his future conduct as
regards the respect due to the institutions of the
Church, when, on the morning after the end of the
fast, which was to be a day of great rejoicing, I
intimated my determination to eat no more flesh
meat for at least a week. After all my jests about
the folly of fasting, telling my people that during
the continuance of such terms of abstinence, I was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
a good Mahomedan, and having by my example on
more than one occasion, tempted him and the
others of my household to indulge in food when
they ought to have been observing a stricter discipline—after
all this, on the day appointed for
rejoicing, to see all appetite taken from me was so
evidently a judgment from heaven, that I was
strongly recommended to propitiate the Virgin
Mary immediately by bestowing the goat, which
the Negoos had sent to me at Myolones, upon a
church dedicated to the Mother of Christ. So
disinterested in fact, was Walderheros, that he
went off to procure one of the priests upon the
establishment, and who, when he arrived, had I
carried out my servant’s intentions, would have
walked away with the goat immediately, such was
his anxiety for my restoration to the favour of
heaven.</p>

<p>I could not be very well angry with Walderheros,
and I was too ill either to laugh at, or to endeavour
to convert the priest, so I dismissed him with an
ahmulah, for his willingness to relieve me of the
supposed ban under which I was laid. When he
was gone, however, the weather having cleared up
a little, I directed my servants to kill the goat, and
to ask such of their Christian friends who lived in
Aliu Amba to come to the party on the occasion,
as I wanted it eaten up, that no temptation should
exist to divert me from my resolution not to take
any animal food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
The best butcher in the place, Tinta’s misselannee,
who had always shown himself ready to
render assistance whenever I required some extra
hand, could not, of course, be omitted. Gwalior,
another servant of Tinta, and a patient of mine, was
also called in at the death of the doomed goat, which
gallantly showed fight, surrounded, as he was, by a
host of hungry enemies, who, besides seeking the
satisfaction of revenge for the indiscriminate tuppings
and bumpings he had given and occasioned among
the party, had had their interest excited by the
portions of his venison mutton, that each, in the
mind’s eye, already saw hanging up in a mimosa
tree that grew in my garden, and which formed the
shambles generally on such occasions.</p>

<p>A lot of yelping boys came into the enclosure,
and crowded about the butchers aiding the goat in
his attempts to get away, by attempting to catch
him, and of course running in the way of those
who might have been able to do it. A number
of women also thronged in as the stir became
faster, and who stood around me as a kind
of body-guard, for the leaping “diabolus”
of a goat sometimes threatened even to make
our heads a stepping-stone to fly over the high
enclosure. A long lasso at length being thrown
ignobly at his feet, the next move he made ensnared
him by the leg, and the triumph of his life-hunters
was complete. The rope being run around the
trunk of the mimosa, the unwilling goat was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
dragged, like a victim of Spanish civil war, backwards
to his doom, and a prayer of peace being
muttered by the clerk, Walderheros, the high priest,
the misselannee, cut the throat of their prey, the
invocation of the Trinity, like the Islam “ul
Allah,” sanctifying the bloody business of depriving
an animal of life.</p>

<p>It is singular to observe the pertinacity of
custom, and how characteristic of descent particular
habits and ceremonies become long after the
separation of different nations from their original
root. The Arabs, the Amhara, or the Abyssinians,
and the Jews, all precede the slaughter of animals
for food with some short prayer, which, differing in
form, is still the same custom, and which, I think,
originated at a period antecedent to their dispersion as
different nations into the several countries they now
occupy. It has also continued among them, even
changed as these nations are in religion and social
character, the Hebrew trader, the Arab nomade
shepherd, and the Abyssinian agriculturist. Jew,
Mahomedan, and Christian, still retain this evidence
of a common origin, but which marks an ethnological
era posterior, I believe, by many centuries to
the more general custom of circumcision common to
all these people, and to many other African nations.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
Such a goat as had just been killed, fed up to
the high condition he was in, could not have been
bought in the market for less than ten ahmulahs,
two shillings and twopence. The skin alone,
however, is supposed to be worth three ahmulahs;
and great care is taken not to injure it with the
point of the knife, when flaying the carcase.
To be of any value, it must be taken off
uncut, except around the neck, and in those
situations necessary to enable the butchers to
draw the legs out of the skin. Also, of course,
where the first incision is made to commence the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
process, and which is a circular cut carried around
both haunches, not many inches from and having
the tail for a centre. The hide is then stripped
over the thighs, and two smaller incisions being
made around the middle joint of the hind legs,
enable them to be drawn out. A stick is now
placed to extend these extremities, and by this, for
the convenience of the operators, the whole
carcase is suspended from the branch of a tree, and
by some easy pulls around the body, the skin is
gradually withdrawn over the forelegs, which are
incised around the knees to admit of their being
taken out; after which, the head being removed,
the whole business concludes by the skin being
pulled inside out over the decollated neck. One of
the parties now takes a rough stone and well rubs
the inside surface, to divest it of a few fibres of the
subcutaneous muscle which are inserted into the
skin, and after this operation it is laid aside until
the next day; the more interesting business of
attending to the meat calling immediate attention.</p>

<p>These entire skins are afterwards made into
sacks by the apertures around the neck and legs
being secured by a double fold of the skin being
sewed upon each other, by means of a slender but
very tough thong. These small seams are rendered
quite air-tight, and the larger orifice around the
haunches being gathered together by the hands, the
yet raw skin is distended with air, and the orifice
being then tied up, the swollen bag is left in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
state for a few days until slight putrefaction has commenced,
when the application of the rough stone
soon divests its surface of the hair. After this has
been effected, a deal of labour, during at least one
day, is required to soften the distended skin by
beating it with heavy sticks, or trampling upon it
for hours together, the labourer supporting himself
by clinging to the bough of a tree over head, or
holding on by the wall of the house. In this
manner, whilst the skin is drying, it is prevented
from getting stiff, and still further to secure it from
this evil condition, it is frequently rubbed with
small quantities of butter. When it is supposed that
there is no chance of the skin becoming hard and
easily broken, the orifice is opened, the air escapes,
and a very soft flaccid leather bag is produced, but
which, for several days after, affords an amusement
to the owner, when otherwise unemployed, by well
rubbing it all over with his hands.</p>

<p>Almost all the produce of the fields is conveyed
to the market in such sacks as these—cotton, grain,
and the Berberah pepper. It is even the only moneybag
employed to carry home the salt returns for the
different wares that have been sold. None other
could have been employed by Joseph’s brethren
when they loaded their asses and went down into
Egypt; for none are more naturally the resources
of a shepherd people, or better adapted by their
form and size for the little useful animal which
seems to have been as universally employed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
the Jews as by the Amhara of the present day. By
a species of gratitude, sincere as it is deserved,
<i>hiyah</i>, the word signifying <i>ass</i>, is used by the
latter people as another designation for friend; and
I well remember the mistake of a learner of that
language who went into a great rage by being
accosted “hiyah” by an Amhara friend.</p>

<p>The skins of sheep and of small goats are made
into parchment by being more particularly divested
of the fleshy fibres with the rough stone, and then,
after the hairs have been removed by putrefaction,
simply drying in the sun. For this purpose, it is
stretched in a favourable situation, a few inches
from the ground, by a number of small wooden
pegs, which are inserted into small apertures made
in the edge of the skin, and it is thus prevented
from becoming corrugated during the process of
drying.</p>

<p>In the same manner, the larger hides of cows and
oxen are dried, most frequently before putrefaction
has produced any effect upon the hairs, and which,
of course, then remain. This is the general seat
for visitors during the day, and their bed at night,
unless a tanned hide (<i>nit</i>, as it is termed) can be
procured, and which is considered softer and more
suitable for a respected guest.</p>

<p>The <i>nit</i>, or leather, is tanned by being made into
a kind of trough, which contains an infusion of
the bark of the <i>kantuffa</i> acacia. This trough is
formed by a skin being loosely extended upon four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
stick supports, which elevate it about a foot from
the ground. The kantuffa bark, after being well
pounded in a mortar, is strewed over the surface,
and the hollow is then filled with cold water, and
in the course of a few days a strong red infusion is
made, with which the whole surface of the skin is
frequently washed, and when evaporation has reduced
its contents to a sloppy paste, the sticks are
withdrawn, the ends folded in, and with the contained
mass, the skin then undergoes the usual
fatiguing process of treading, until the evidences of
the nit being properly prepared are satisfactory.</p>

<p>The bark of the <i>kantuffa</i> reminded me of that of
the red mimosa of Adal, which produced an astringent
gum, something like <i>kino</i>, but not, I considered,
so powerful a drug. This tree, however, was
pointed out to me as being that with the bark of
which the Dankalli tan their affaleetahs, or small
water-skins, carried by travellers; for the larger ones
are prepared with the hair left on, by simply drying
in the hot sun, after having been distended with
air, to expose them fully to its influence. It is
very probable that the celebrated Morocco leather,
derives its bright red colour from the bark employed
in tanning being obtained either from the
kantuffa or the Adal tree, for both these trees give
a very red colour to the skins that are prepared
with their bark. From this I am inclined to
believe, that among other articles of commerce that
might be advantageously drawn from the Barbar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
states in the north of Africa, a good tanning bark
could be obtained in considerable quantities, and at
a very reasonable rate.</p>

<p>Walderheros and the misselannee proceeded to
carve the flayed carcase, not in any systematic
manner, as I could observe, but directed chiefly in
the size of the lumps of meat that were cut off by
the character of the individual to whom they were
severally assigned: thus, Tinta got a noble haunch
forwarded to him, whilst, on the other hand, the
<i>matrabier</i>, or axe, was called in to aid in dividing
the other into three portions, for as many minor
acquaintances of my servants. In the same manner,
a certain number of ribs were counted for Gwalior,
but the mother of Goodaloo got a great many more
of the opposite side, and in this irregular manner,
after a very busy scene of some two or three hours,
except the portions which Walderheros had retained
for himself, the whole of the goat had disappeared
by degrees through the wicket of the
inclosure, for the rain that was now commencing
prevented the party from holding the festival in the
garden, and I was a great deal too ill to have it
celebrated within my own house.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> A singular fact connected with this custom of making a short
prayer, whilst slaughtering the victim, I gathered from a note in a
recent edition of “Sale’s Koran.” It appears that by a decision of
those learned in the law, which is laid down in that book, animals
killed by the Jews may be partaken of by Mahomedans. A representation
to the Cadi of Cairo having been made, that nearly all the
butchers of that city were followers of the law of Moses, they
were about to be suspended from that employment, when their Chief
Rabbi proved to the satisfaction of their Moslem judges, that the
Koran bids Mahomedans not to refuse food which has been
sanctified to the one true God, which was always done by those
who professed the faith of Abraham and the law of Moses, when
killing animals for food. This circumstance, and also the disrespect
shown by the Whaabbees to the tomb of the Prophet, and the
temple at Mecca, demonstrate to my satisfaction that education
alone is required to show to the Mahomedans, the absurdity of the
false hopes with which their Prophet has surrounded the worship of
the only one God, and of the inapplicability of his laws to improve
or humanize mankind. I could point out, if this were a proper
place, proofs without end, of the liberality and extreme toleration
of learned and enlightened Mahomedans, and we ought not to
attribute the bigotry of ignorance, alike fierce and cruel in Christian,
Mahomedan, and Jew, to their <em>religious belief</em>, which on
examination will be found to have been originally very similar
amongst all these denominations, and that the greatest differences
appear to be in the several codes of social laws adopted by each.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>August 24th.</i>—Early this morning, Tinta appeared
at my house. He had returned from Ankobar the
night before, and had brought an invitation or command,
that if I were able I should visit the Negoos
at Debra Berhan, on the 24th of September,
upon which day a great national festival is held in
honour of the anniversary of the discovery of the
Cross by the Empress Helena. This is called the
<i>muscal</i> from a similar word signifying <i>cross</i>, and is
a kind of military review, before the Negoos, of all
his forces, every tenant and slave capable of bearing
arms being expected to be present. It is, in fact, an
Abyssinian wapentake, and its real origin, although
at the present time concealed by the substitution
of a religious name and purpose, may be still traced
to the same social institutions that first established
similar feudal parades among the older European
nations. I shall dismiss the subject at present,
however, with the single remark, that no Mahomedan,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
except he wear the <i>matab</i> for the occasion of
the muscal, or the expeditions against the Gallas,
is expected to appear as a soldier before the
Negoos; the Wallasmah Mahomed having all claim
upon military service from those inhabitants of Shoa
who profess that religion.</p>

<p>With Tinta came a gunman of the Negoos’ body
guard, named Karissa, with whom I was previously
acquainted, and who, having injured the lock of
his new musket, now came to solicit me to set it to
rights, under the full impression that I had been
brought up to the business. Finding on examination
that a small fragment of the catch of the
trigger was only broken off, which prevented it
being held properly in the groove of the tumbling
portion of the lock, I promised to do it for him,
but as I had then no spring vice, or files, I told
him he must stop until Tinta could procure them
for me, which the latter promised to do in the
course of the day.</p>

<p>Karissa was a very intelligent Galla, wore his
hair in their usual wild manner, in a series of long
plaited elf-locks, hanging on all sides of his head
and dark brown face. His features were regular
and well defined, which is not very usual among
those considered to be true Galla, but as he came
from Cambat to the south and east of Zingero, and
as I have seen others from the same country who
resembled Karissa very much, future discoveries
have yet to determine to what is owing this difference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
in the appearance of the countenance from
those whom I term Soumaulee Gallas, or the
mulatto progeny of Shankalli and Dankalli parents.
At present it will serve our purpose to class them
as a mixed race between the Amhara and the Shankalli,
or what is more probable, between the
Amhara and the Soumaulee Galla.</p>

<p>As he sat with me all day, and it happened to be
my good day, in contradistinction to the alternate
evil one on which I was afflicted with the ague fit,
I asked him many questions respecting his country
and his parents. As I began to feel more interested
in the conversation, and found that my partial knowledge
of Amharic prevented me from making my
visitor quite understand some of my questions, I sent
Walderheros for Ibrahim, who soon came, and very
readily undertook to act as interpreter and illustrator
of Karissa’s information.</p>

<p>He first told me that he was not a born slave
of the Negoos, but had recommended himself to
the notice of the monarch, by the dexterous manner
in which he had conveyed messages to the Kings of
Enarea, and of his own country, Cambat. For the
fidelity which had marked his return to servitude,
and for his bravery during the rebellion of Matoko
he had been rewarded by being made a <i>nuftania</i>, or
gunman, and would, were he to marry, have a house
bestowed upon him, with as much land as two oxen
could plough in the year.</p>

<p>He had lived several years in Gurague, and had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
crossed the river Gibbee where it passes to the
south of Enarea, and he stated positively that it
flowed into the Abiah, and so far gratified Ibrahim,
who had so described it to me in his geography of
Southern Abyssinia. One circumstance favourable
for my proper understanding of the true situation
of the countries he described as having passed
through in his several journeys was, that Karissa
had crossed the Hawash at Mulkukuyu, so we had
at once a standard of distance that both of us
knew, and this aided me materially in correcting
the situations of many places with the names and
relative positions of which I was already familiar
from my conversations with Ibrahim.</p>

<p>Respecting Ankor, Karissa stated it to be a part
of Enarea, and not of Zingero. He did not know
whether it had ever formed part of the latter
country, which I had heard from another authority,
a Christian duptera, who told me he had read it in
a book belonging to the church of St. Michael, in
Ankobar (where the Negoos deposits the greater
part of his manuscript volumes), that Anquor, or
Ankor, was a province of Zingero. Be that as it
may, from Ankobar to Ankor is three times the
distance between the former place to the ford over
the Hawash, or about 150 miles. Zingero was about
the same distance, directly to the south-west, whilst
Ankor, or that part of Enarea which borders on
the Gibbee, was nearly to the west-south-west. The
sources of the Gibbee were not more than eighty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
miles from Angolahlah, and going on horseback,
Karissa said that he could drink of the waters of that
river before the evening of the second day. The
Gallas of Limmoo he had heard of, but never
visited, so that when I mentioned to him the name
of Ouare, the Galla informant of M. Jomard, and
also Kilho, who is represented as being chief of
that country, he could give me no information
respecting them. The river Abiah he knew was
the same as the Gibbee, and said that it went
through the Shankalli country to Sennaar.</p>

<p>Beyond the Abiah I was now told, a nation of
white people like ourselves existed, but who were
cannibals, and had all their utensils made of iron.
That they boiled and eat all intruders into their
country. He stated positively that he had himself
seen a woman of this people, who had been brought
to Enarea, and who had confirmed all the statements
he was now making to me. As I believe
myself that the Bahr ul Abiad will be found to
have its earlier sources in an isolated table land
like Abyssinia, but of much greater elevation, I
began to suspect that these white people must be
the inhabitants of the country surrounding the
distant sources of this mysterious river, and that as
the Assabi derived its name from flowing through
a country of red people, that the White Nile,
in like manner had been so designated from the
circumstance of its table land being inhabited by
a white race, and as a branch of that river
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
is known by the name of Addo, which I consider to
be the <i>Arian</i> term for <i>white</i>, this added some
confirmation to my ideas. On inquiring, however,
what knowledge Karissa had of the Bahr ul
Abiad, I found that he was entirely ignorant of such
a river, and when I modified the name, by calling it
the river of the Tokruree, or blacks, he instantly
conceived I was speaking of the Kalli, that is well
known to flow to the south and east of Kuffah into
the Indian Ocean, and by which caravans of slaves
are constantly passing between Zingero and the
coast of Zanzibar. There must, in fact, exist in
this situation a most available road into the very
centre of the continent of Africa, for I have subsequently
seen Nubian slaves who had been in the
service of Zaid Zaid, Imaum of Zanzibar, that corroborated
this statement of Karissa in every particular
respecting the transit of slaves across the table land
of Abyssinia, from Sennaar to Lamoo on the Indian
Ocean, and so to the market of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>I was, however, more interested in the account
I received of the white people, and which was as exaggerated
a relation, as many of the reports received
by some travellers respecting the Doko dwarfs.
To retail here all the absurd nonsense that Karissa
entertained me with would be sadly misappropriating
space, but I could gather from the reports
that a singular race of men live in the most jealous
seclusion, in a large desert-surrounded table land,
similar in many respects to that of Abyssinia. That
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
they were civilized was evident, from the fact of
their writing being said to be quite different from
the Geez, and it is not a nation just emerged from
barbarism that would possess a knowledge of such
an abstruse art as that of writing. As to the tale
of their being cannibals, I recollected that even at
the present day the very same report is entertained,
and believed by the Negroes around Kordofan of
European habits, and that we ourselves are supposed
by them to be cannibals. This is, in
fact, a charge so easily made, and serves so
admirably to heighten the horrible, in a picture of
a barbarous people drawn by an imaginative mind,
that even among modern travellers we find an
inclination to spread such rumours, without any
examination as to their correctness, and sometimes,
from a hasty conclusion, or an error in interpretation,
without any foundation whatever. In this manner,
a stigma of cannibalism has been attached to the
Dankalli, but which only shows how careful
travellers ought to be before they promulgate
such strange and absurd stories.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Nothing can be positively asserted; but I
believe, myself, that we are on the eve of a most
interesting ethnological and geographical discovery,
that will at once afford a solution to all the strange
and improbable accounts which have reached us
respecting the inhabitants of Central Africa. What
we hear of dwarfs, cannibals, and communities of
monkeys, may, perhaps, prove to be merely a
muddied stream of information, conveyed to us
through the medium of ignorant and barbarous
tribes; but which may have a foundation of an
unexpected character, in the existence of a nation
in this situation; which, almost physically separated
from the rest of the world by impassable deserts
and unnavigable rivers, has continued in its original
integrity that perfect condition of society which,
once general, then almost extinguished, evidently
preceded the barbarism from which the present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
transition state has emerged, and which I believe
to be gradually progressing to the re-attainment
of the previous excellence of the primeval social
institutions.</p>

<p>One strange report respecting the inhabitants of
intra-tropical Africa, I think I shall be able to
show the origin and foundation of, and which is the
existence, in a situation to the south of Kuffah, of
a nation of dwarfs, called Doko. From the information
I have received myself, and from an examination
of unpublished Portuguese documents
relative to the geography of the eastern coast of
Africa, and of the people inland; in the very situation
presumed to be the native country of the
Doko, I learn that a very different family of man
is only to be found—the tall, muscular, and powerful
Shankalli negro; and, more than this, the
French traveller, M. d’Abbadie, from information
received in Abyssinia, has reported that to the
south of Enarea and Kuffah, a nation of Shankalli
reside, to whom the name Doko was given. It
cannot, therefore, I think, be doubted that a people
so designated do occupy the country to the south
of Abyssinia, and that from among them are taken
the greater number of slaves, that arrive at the
markets of Enarea and Zingero, where the dealers
dispose of them to the slave Kafilahs that are
proceeding to Zanzibar, or to northern Abyssinia.
Doko perhaps designates the slave country, or, perhaps,
signifies as much as our <i lang="la">terra incognita</i>, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
we find the same word entering into the name of
the unknown countries situated to the south of
Bornou and the Mandara range, and, therefore, the
Dukalata of those portions on the west of Africa
may correspond with the equally unknown country
of the Doko upon the eastern side.</p>

<p>The accounts, however, lately received of the
dwarfs of central Africa, is not new information,
but is merely the revival of a very old idea, which
in less enlightened times was naturally enough
entertained by just and properly constituted
minds, who acknowledged the greatness of the
natural truths which had been demonstrated to
them, by thus not refusing to believe that
which with their limited knowledge, they could
not consistently deny might be possible. It is this
which characterizes the humility of genius, and
which is rewarded by the light which must result
from the inquiries excited by such expectations.
But it becomes a proof of no little mental obtuseness,
when the probability of any popular rumour is
insisted upon, after the knowledge of facts has so
far accumulated, as to enable us to demonstrate its
absurdity. No reasonable being can positively deny
the existence of a nation of very short statured
men in Africa, but that he must believe because
there may be such a people, that the animals
described as the Doko dwarfs, are them, is quite out
of the question. The real dwarfs may, ultimately,
prove to be the Gonga people, and most probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
they are. I have some singular evidence upon this
very subject, which I only wish somewhat farther
to confirm, to lay before the public; but shall at
present confine myself to denying, that the Doko, of
modern Abyssinian fable, represent the dwarfs
alluded to by the naturalists of antiquity; or, that,
in fact, they are men at all.</p>

<p>Ludolph and d’Lisle are, I believe, still the
great authorities upon the geography of interior
Africa; their maps were evidently constructed from
well compared and long considered information;
and conjectural geographers of the present day,
are too glad, when their theories accord in any
way with the delineation of these countries as
represented by those authors. On examination of
their maps it will be perceived, that both received
such apparently well-authenticated accounts, of a
nation of dwarfs dwelling to the South of Abyssinia,
that they had been obliged to recognise their
existence, and, of course, to find them a locality.</p>

<p>Ludolph, whose knowledge of the Geez and
Amharic probably prevented him from considering
the accounts of so great an importance as did the
French geographer, only notices, by a small note
appended to the name on the map, that the King
of Zingero was stated to be a monkey. In the
body of his work, however, he represents that he
received considerable information respecting a
nation of dwarfs living in this situation, and who
accord in so many respects with the Doko of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
present day, that there cannot be any reasonable
doubt, but that both have resulted from similar
popular rumours that have continued to us, from
the time of Ludolph. A plate in his very interesting
“History of Ethiopia,” actually gives the presumed
character of these so-called dwarfs, and who are represented
in several situations characteristic of their
habits, among which appears as most prominent that
of being employed in devouring ants, which we
are told also forms the principal food of the Doko.
Ludolph, however, has so much respect for human
nature as not to picture these dwarfs as men, but
in every respect has delineated them as monkeys;
and when it is understood that the word Zingero in
Amharic signifies baboon, as well as the name of a
large kingdom in the south of Shoa, the connexion
of words and the confusion of ideas will be allowed
to be quite natural, when we consider the ignorance
of the Abyssinian informants, and the imperfect
knowledge of their language, more especially of
its synonymes, by even the most learned of the
travellers from whom had been received any account
of that country. It was this which misled Ludolph,
although from the cautious note upon the map
respecting the King of Zingero being stated to be
a monkey, it appears that he had certain
doubts, but his fidelity as a <em>closet</em> geographer and
historian did not allow him to throw aside the information,
merely because his own opinion did not
accord with that which he was told to be the fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
M. d’Lisle seems to have been perfectly satisfied
as to the human nature of the Government, and of
course the people of Zingero, but still he was
trammeled with a nation of so-called dwarfs,
which in his days were represented to occupy a
tract of country more remote than the Abyssinian
kingdom of Zingero, so we find that in his map
encircling that country to the west and south, a
nation of dwarfs is placed, the name of whom, he
was informed, was Makoko. Exactly as in the case
of the <i>Zingero</i> of Ludolph, Makoko is nothing more
but the Amharic term for monkey, and of course
the same explanation proves the connexion of
these Makoko dwarfs with those animals, and also
of their identity with the same reported race of
which Ludolph had previously recorded his knowledge,
although, as I have before said, their
existence as a nation was not so insisted upon by
him as it appears to have been by d’Lisle.</p>

<p>I will now direct attention to the principal
characteristics of the modern Doko, but I may
observe, that no Abyssinian I ever questioned
upon the subject, either learned duptera, or
Kuffah slave, could give me any information,
excepting an old servant of Dr. Krapf, Roophael,
who seemed fully acquainted with them, and
I have seen him amusing a whole circle of Shoans
with his relation of these people. But be it observed
that Ludolph’s “History of Ethiopia”
formed a part of his master’s library, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
appeared perfectly familiar with the plate of the
ant-eating monkeys, to which he always referred
as his authority for his strange tale. The fullest
account of these dwarfs is found in Major Harris’s
recent work, “The Highlands of Æthiopia,” where
we are told, “Both sexes go perfectly naked, and
have thick pouting lips, diminutive eyes, and flat
noses.” “They are ignorant of the use of fire.”
“<em>Fruits</em> are their principal food, and to obtain
these, women as well as men ascend the trees in
numbers, and in their quarrels and scrambles not
unfrequently throw each other from the branches.”
“They have no king, no laws, no arts, no arms,
possess neither flocks nor herds, are not hunters,
do not cultivate the soil, but subsist entirely upon
fruits, roots, mice, <em>reptiles</em>, <em>ants</em>, and honey.” These,
such as they are described, cannot certainly be men
possessing reasoning powers, and without that
necessary characteristic of human nature, I cannot
conceive how the idea could have been entertained
for an instant, that the Doko belonged to our
species, or that they could have been believed to be
the dwarfs, supposed to exist in Africa by those
ancient authors who have in their works treated
upon the subject. Had it been shown that they
possessed any attribute of humanity; a knowledge
of God, for example, beyond a mere prostration
with their feet against a tree, and a calling upon
“<i>Yare! Yare!</i>” when in trouble or pain; or of
social order beyond mere gregarious instinct; or of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
the simplest arts of life requiring the exercise of the
least reasoning powers, then there might have been
some reason to accord to the Doko the dignity of
belonging to our species; but when we are fully
acquainted with the character and manner of living
of an animal that coincides exactly with the chief
characteristics of the habits of the Doko, it would
have been more philosophical to have classed them
at once with monkeys. In that case, no reasonable
objection could have been made to the supposition
that they were a new and distinct variety of that
animal, and which, perhaps, admitted of domestication
to a much greater extent than any with which
we are at present acquainted. It is probable,
indeed, that this will be found to be the foundation
of the whole story, for we are told that “their
docility and usefulness, added to very limited wants,
render them in high demand. None are ever sold
out of the countries bordering the Gochob, and
none, therefore, find their way to Shoa.” This I
consider to be another evidence of their being
monkeys, for had they been real men and women,
slave-dealers would most certainly have conveyed some
of them either into northern Abyssinia or to Zanzibar.
The plea of humanity, which has been stated to
actuate these traffickers in human flesh not to
separate the faithful and affectionate Doko from
his master, I am glad to observe is too absurd not
to be suppressed; but it is no reason why I should
not mention this part of the statement as an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
additional evidence of the entirely ridiculous character
of the information that has excited lately
some little interest and attention among ethnologists
in Europe, as to the probable existence of a
new variety of the human species in intertropical
Africa.</p>

<p>That the Doko may be monkeys admitting of
considerable domestication I am the more inclined
to believe, from the fact that the ancient Egyptians
did call to their aid such a species of animal
servants; and in many of the representations of
the habits and arts of that interesting people will
be found instances where monkeys are employed
upon the duty they are so well adapted for—that
of collecting fruits for their masters. At the present
day we have no practice similar to this in the
customs of any known people; but among other
novelties to reward future enterprise, will be
probably the identification of the Doko of Kuffah
with the house-monkey of ancient Egypt, and their
docility and usefulness, in that case, may then
lead to their being introduced into other countries
adapted to their constitutions, and where their
services may be required. Such an animal, among
a people subsisting upon fruits and vegetables,
would be as valuable as the sheep-dog to a herdsman,
or as the domesticated cormorant to the fish-eating
inhabitants on some of the canals in China.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> One evening, on my return from Abyssinia, in company with
the British Political Mission, a Galayla Muditu appeared in the
camp. Around his head was placed the brindled shaggy tail of a
hyena, which added not a little to the savage appearance of the
man. He squatted on his heels in the customary manner, and
most of the Europeans surrounded him, to look at the extreme of
barbarism his figure and appearance presented. Several of our
Kafilah men joined us, volunteering information; among other
things, it was observed by a slave-dealer, that the man before us
“was a bad man” (pointing at the same time to the Hyena’s tail),
“that eats man,” meaning of course, that the man being a
Mahomedan, was very wicked for wearing any part of such a
corpse-eating beast about his person. I met this very slave-merchant,
who had thus expressed himself, some weeks afterwards,
in the Red Sea, and as we were together on board the same vessel
for several days, our conversation was frequently upon Abyssinian
matters. I once recalled the scene of the so-called man-eater,
and he was astonished, certainly, when I told him it was reported
that the Dankalli were cannibals, and that the picture of this very
Galayla Muditu was taken with that idea, as a portrait of a man-eater.
Dankalli Mahomed, as he was then called, never came
afterwards to sit with me and my friend, Padre Antonio Foggart,
but he went through the process of sawing his throat, as if cutting
it with a knife, to intimate how any cannibal would be punished if
he appeared in their country.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Karissa</span> remained the whole day at my house, for
Tinta had been obliged to send to Ankobar for a
spring vice. A discharged servant of the Embassy,
named Sultaun, who resided in Aliu Amba, brought
two files, which I purchased from him for a few
charges of gunpowder, but until the return of
Tinta’s messenger, I was obliged to postpone
repairing the gun-lock. When the required
instrument did come, it was too late to do anything,
so Karissa stayed all night, turning in upon
an ox-skin, and sharing the porch of my house with
Goodaloo.</p>

<p>The next morning (Aug. 25) I set about the
business, and managed to put all to rights before
noon, during which time we had a long conversation
upon the origin of the Galla, and, in fact, of
all other nations, for the traditions he related
reached to the very remotest times. How far his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
information was founded upon recorded history I
cannot say, but he referred it to the conversations
of some priests of Gurague, with whom the early
part of his life had been spent, and much of what I
collected upon this subject (the ethnology of the
inhabitants of Abyssinia) from Karissa, was by his
asking if such and such a thing that he had
heard were true. Ibrahim was as much amused
as I was, for, without supposing it, our Galla
friend was contributing considerably to the knowledge
of both.</p>

<p>Of the Gallas themselves, he could only tell me
that they originally came from <i>Bargamo</i>, which
was represented to be a large water, across which
the distant opposite side was just visible. That
their ancestors, dwelling upon the farther shore,
were induced to come over into Abyssinia, which
they soon overran and conquered. Karissa always
pointed to the south as the situation of <i>Bargamo</i>,
or I was inclined to suppose that by this was
intended the country around the shores of lake
Tchad, the eastern portion of which, we learn from
Clapperton and Denham, is called Berghamie. He
was very curious to know if I were of a nation of
whites of whom he had heard, called <i>Surdi</i>, and
which, in his system of mankind lore, constituted
one of the three great divisions of mankind into
which the whole world was divided. There was
no question about himself, for he was a Tokruree,
or black, whilst Ibrahim, although not much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
lighter complexioned, was an Amhara, or red man.
The <i>Surdi</i> he insisted as existing, and was contented
to believe, although I did not seem to know
anything about them, that I was of that race.</p>

<p>His fathers, Karissa said, all believed that at
one period the people of the whole earth were of
one colour and language, and that the first man,
like Adam, was produced from clay. Here I may
observe, that the Abyssinians all contend that the
real signification of the word Adam is first, and
is a form of Adu, the Geez for the numeral
one, and as such was once used to designate the
first day of the week, and the first month of
the year. Kádama is also another modification
of the same word, signifying <em>before</em> the first.
A very interesting comparison can be therefore
made between the Mosaical account of the Creation
and that which has been preserved in Manetho as
the Phœnician record of the same event; for the
name of the first mortal in the list <i>Primogenus</i> will
bear an interpretation similar to the Geez translation
of Adam, or <i>the first</i>. That which makes the
identity more striking between the two narratives
is, that the name of the first woman, according to
Manetho, or rather the older writer, Sanchoniathon,
was Æon, which is the very word that is given in
the Genesis of the Geez Scriptures as the name of
our common mother, and which, by tracing it
through its modifications in Arabic, Hebrew, and
the Greek, to our own language, will be found to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
be the original of the word Eve. That Æon
appears to have been the word which designated
the mother of mankind, we have the circumstance
that it retains the signification of mother to the
present day, with slight alterations depending upon
dialects; for the Amhara of Tigre call the word
mother, Eno, whilst in Shoa, Enart is the term
employed. The connexion of the name Eve with
the motive given for bestowing it, contained in the
third chapter of Genesis, cannot, in fact, be perceived
unless we admit this interpretation; for we
are expressly told, that Adam gave his wife that
name because “she was the <em>mother</em> of all living.”
To this also I may add, that by deriving the name
<i>Adam</i> from the Geez <i>Adu</i>, giving that name both
to the man and woman, as in the second verse of
the fifth chapter of Genesis, “And calling <em>their</em> name
<i>Adam</i>,” occasions no confusion, as it implies simply
that they were <em>the first</em>. I have brought home with
me two or three Ethiopic manuscripts relative to
the subject of the creation of the world; for I believe
by a careful comparison we shall find still retained
in Geez literature the original from which Sanchoniathon,
and perhaps other historians, have derived
the accounts, at present received, of the first creation
of man; at all events, the Amhara reject the authority
of Genesis, and adhere to one which accords much
more with the profane historian of the Phœnicians.</p>

<p>To return, however, to Karissa and the Galla
people, their ancient history is no less interesting, nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
will it prove less important when we possess fuller
information respecting the religion they profess.
It is such a field for conjecture that I decline to
enter upon the subject, except to note that they
worship a limited number of principal deities, but
recognising also a numerous host of demigods,
whose influence upon man and his affairs are
exerted most malevolently, and who can only be
propitiated by sacrifices and entreaties. <i>Waak</i>,
however, appears to be the supreme god who made
the world and every inferior deity. Waak has no
visible representative, but is everywhere, and exists
in everything. He is the limit of all knowledge;
for “<i>Waak segallo</i>” (God knows) invariably expresses
ignorance of a fact, and the best definition
of him I could get from the most informed Galla I
ever conversed with upon the subject was, that he
was the “unknown God.” Waak is, I think, the
only deity proper to the Galla people, although
long intercourse with the Gongas has made them
acquainted with a mythology which would show,
had I only space to enter into the subject, a most
extraordinary connexion with that of the ancient
Egyptians. They have also derived some knowledge
of one or two of the principal saints <em>worshipped</em> by
the Greek Church, and according to their situation
with respect to the Christians of Abyssinia or
the Pagans of Zingero, so is their religion modified
by the errors or absurdities of their neighbours,
and which is another reason why I suspect that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
originally the unknown god Waak, was alone the
object of pure Galla worship. It is singular that
very ancient travellers, Cosmas Indicopleustes, for
example, surround the then known world by a
<i lang="la">terra incognita</i> which is inscribed as Wak-wak;
whilst Edrisi, the old Arabian geographer, makes
this the name also by which he describes the present
Galla countries, and which d’Lisle, by an interesting
Gascon provincialism, as it aids me in my interpretation,
makes this word Bake-bake, and places it
to the south of Abyssinia, I have been led therefore to
believe that the worship of the most ancient god of
India, which European nations in the classic ages
adopted under the name of Bacchus, was supposed
to characterize the inhabitants of the
regions that were so designated, and hence the
reason of describing unknown countries as lands
of <i>Wak-wak</i>. If so, and <i>Waak</i> can be by future
travellers identified by other particulars with the
Bacchus of the ancients, it will be a most
important corroboration of the origin of the Galla
with an Asiatic people who invaded Africa at a
very early period. It is not one volume that would
exhaust this subject; nor is it one journey that
can give a traveller a just right to impose his
opinions upon his readers. The dissipation of a
deal of obscurity respecting the earlier history of
man, and, in fact, of his original nature, and of his
primeval institutions, will be the glorious reward of
future enterprise; and since the days of Columbus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
no subject of more stirring interest, or of greater
importance has been discussed, than the probability
of finding in Central Africa a country characterized
by the civilization of China, but more purely sustained
in its original excellence by its isolated position,
surrounded by burning deserts, that like “flaming
swords,” turn every way to keep the way of “the
tree of life.” To me, it almost appears such a
community of man is shadowed out in the mystical
language of the sacred historian; and though I
do not expect to find a paradise, still there is that
in Central Africa that will well reward those adventurous
spirits who will press on to explore its
unknown portions.</p>

<p>The empty iron-bound chest taught the man
who opened it, industry; and even if no wonderful
discovery be made, knowledge, must result from a
journey across the mysterious continent.</p>

<p>I return again to Karissa and his system of
ethnology, for out of the question of my being one
of the nation of whites, or <i>Surdi</i>, a conversation
grew, by which I perceived the very simple system
of the original separation of man that is entertained
by the Abyssinians, and their ideas upon which are
singularly confirmed by what is observed in our own
extent of knowledge. This is, that originally three
families of man occupied three distinct countries,
each divided by their respective seas; and that
Tokruree, the blacks, were separated from the
whites by a white sea; which I find actually to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
mean the Mediterranean, so called by Arabian
geographers, from being supposed to belong to
the white people. The red people, again, were the
Asiatics, the Assyrians of Jewish historians; and
the sea which separated them from Tokruree, or
Africa, was, and is called to the present day, the
Red Sea, from the reason of its being situated
upon the borders of a country inhabited by a red
race of men; whilst the black people, had also
their particular sea, which is that which intervenes
between India and Zanzibar, and which
still bears that name in Arabic and Indian
geographies. This simple division of the earth
seems to have been the popular idea of ethnology
at a very early period; for all the various names of
Alps, Albania, Albion, and numerous others, of
Latin and Greek combination, having reference to
this colour, prove that the ancient designation of
Europeans was “the whites,” and which appears to
have been as general and as familiar a term to use,
as is the word blacks, or Negroes, or Tokruree, when,
at the present day, we speak of those coloured
inhabitants of Africa; whilst on the other hand the
derivation of Asia from Assa, a word which signifies
red, is both easy and natural. Of the word Tokruree,
and its Geez signification, my reader must be well
aware that it means <em>blacks</em>, or Negroes, and is
the significant and expressive designation of those
people.</p>

<p>After some more conversation upon the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
subjects, as the day was drawing to a close, Karissa
took up his musket, and made preparations for
departing; but before he went insisted upon my
promising to ask the Negoos that he might be
allowed to accompany me to Enarea when I
went, to which place he undertook to conduct me,
through Gurague, with perfect safety, and would
only require such a present as I could give him,
upon our return to Shoa. The journey would not
require more than one month to accomplish it,
including all detentions and necessary delays. It
only required, he said, the permission of the
Negoos; who, in that case, would send an affaro,
or servant, to see me safe upon my journey, and to
bear the royal commands for assistance to his
governors or friends. It was this appointment of
affaro Karissa desired, and none other could have
been better qualified, had circumstances been
so ordered as to have admitted of my proceeding
farther; but situated as I was, worn out by disease,
and reduced to my last seven or eight dollars, I
could hold out no hope to Karissa beyond saying
that I should apply to the Negoos for permission
to go to Enarea, and if I went he should be sure to
accompany me.</p>

<p>I learned from this man that Sahale Selassee
possesses at least one thousand firearms, of which
three or four hundred are European muskets. Of
these the British Embassy had presented three
hundred, and before its return one hundred and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
forty more had been brought up by M. Rochet
d’Hericourt. With the Kafilah I accompanied
there were more than fifty pistols, all of which
were given by the Ambassador to the Negoos.
These small weapons were quite unsuited to
Amhara soldiers, who like long shots about as
well as any military, it has ever been my fortune
to observe in actual combat. The pistols, however,
were not altogether useless, for, by the
orders of the sagacious monarch, several of the
best matchlocks were immediately new stocked
and fitted with the locks of the former, and
were thus rendered much more available as fire-arms.</p>

<p>There are no less than four descriptions of
guns in the armoury of the Negoos. The first and
most ancient being termed <i>balla quob</i>, are immense
long old-fashioned affairs. Each require three or
four individuals to hold, whilst another runs up
with a lighted stick to discharge it; when those
who stand behind, find it most desirable to get out of
the way, for the recoil throws it several yards out
of the hands of the gunmen. The second kind
is called <i>balla matatchah</i>, and is the common
matchlock; many of these, I was assured, were
formerly <i>balla quob</i>, but that a Gypt several years
before had visited Shoa, and so far benefited the
Negoos by reducing his long pieces into something
like portable guns. The next kind, and most in
favour, were the English and French muskets,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
called <i>balla dinghi</i>, and only to those whom he
most favoured did the monarch trust these much
prized arms, every one of which is valued by him
at twenty dollars, the price of two beautiful young
horses. The <i>balla tezarb</i>, or percussion guns, are
those which have come to the Negoos by the
voluntary contribution of strangers, or the direct
application of the monarch for the coveted weapon
at whatever price may be demanded. My single-barreled
fowling-piece was destined to the same
resting-place with nearly all the valuable stock of
private fire-arms brought up to Shoa by the
members of the Embassy, who found it very
difficult to retain more than one or two guns each
for their own use. The less valuable of these <i>balla
tezarb</i> are distributed among the superior courtiers
as great marks of favour, and besides, two or three
favourite pages have occasionally lent to them, by
the Negoos, guns for their amusement; and he
rewards them also for such petty services as cannot
well be paid in any other manner, by scanty donations
of four or five percussion caps at a time.
These constitute a good coin in the precincts
of the palace, and a great deal of attention and
civility may be commanded in exchange for a few
caps.</p>

<p>The Shoan gunpowder, as I have before described,
is very bad, and also, from the want of lead, all
manufactured bullets are made of small pieces of
iron, hammered into a round form. Many of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
gunmen, however, are obliged to substitute small
round pebbles, as the Negoos never distributes to
each more than five or seven of the iron ones,
on occasions even of the most extensive expeditions.</p>

</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="unindent">Some</span> few days after Karissa had visited me, an
affaro came from the palace at Ankobar, with a
message that I should proceed immediately to see
the Negoos. On inquiring what circumstance had
occurred to occasion such a sudden and urgent
summons, I learned that a Gypt priest had
arrived from Gondah, and that he spoke English,
and for all that my informant knew, might be an
<i>ascar</i> (a subject or servant) of my Queen. As soon
as I heard this, I was in a great hurry to be away,
although, had I consulted common prudence, I
should certainly have postponed the interview,
upon the plea of the exceedingly weak state in
which I was, and the violence of fever attacks
every other day, especially as the height of
Ankobar was entombed in clouds, nor had I seen
its summit for several days past. A mule, however,
being procured, and certain resting-places
during the ride having been determined upon, where
friends of Walderheros or Goodaloo resided, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
started early in the afternoon, and after occupying
the remainder of the day in the ascent, I arrived
at Musculo’s house by sunset. Walderheros went up
to the palace to announce my arrival, and returned in
the course of half an hour with a turbaned monk,
barefooted, and with the usual soft yellow leathern
cape of his order over his shoulders. He was an elderly
man, spare and short, but he came along actively
enough, and as he entered the house, with a good
English accent accosted me with, “How do you
do?” He soon gave me an account of himself and
of his business in Shoa. His present name was Bethlehem,
but by birth he was an Armenian, who had
become somewhat educated in European languages
and customs, by a military service of many years
with the Dutch. From other sources I heard that
he had distinguished himself greatly in several
conflicts, and had received a medal for some particularly
dashing exploit. He, however, had now
forsworn the world and all its vanities, and after
a residence of several years in Abyssinia, had
assumed the turban of the clergy of the Greek
Church in that country, and probably was among
the most correct in conduct, of the members of that
rather lax ministry.</p>

<p>He sat down upon my alga, and after a few
sensible observations upon the evil of countrymen
not being on good terms in a country so
situated as Shoa, and the bad effect produced upon
the mind of the King by the previous quarrels of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
the Embassy with their servants<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and their own
people, he then turned the conversation upon a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
subject which he said was of great interest to the
Negoos, who had been talking to him respecting it
for the last two days. This was the production of indigo
in Shoa, seeds of which plant had been received
from Gondah, and the Negoos desired me to point
out the situation I considered to be most favourable
for their cultivation. Judging from the character of
the country bordering upon the Ganges, its probable
elevation above the sea, and its geographical position,
I had no hesitation in stating, from the comparison,
that many of the little islands of the finest
alluvial soil, situated in the bed of the Dinkee
river, where it extends in broad valleys in the neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
of Farree, would be well calculated for
the interesting experiment.</p>

<p>Our conversation was not, however, altogether
upon this subject, but merely that I might be
prepared for the interview the next day with the
Negoos, when Bethlehem was to act as interpreter.
Information respecting the state of Northern Abyssinia,
as regarded differences in the manners and
customs of the inhabitants from those of Shoa,
was freely volunteered by my new acquaintance,
but who was exceedingly cautious and reserved
upon political matters, so that I supposed that the
discussion was a delicate one, and that his visit
to the Negoos was connected with some business
of that kind. Bethlehem is an intelligent man,
and might be made exceedingly useful, and as
his knowledge of the English language appears
to give him a bias towards the interests of this
country, his probable value as an agent, must
not be passed over without being remarked. As
he was nearly twice as old as myself, I talked
just as much the more in proportion, for I had no
other way of parrying the questions that his
apparently careless curiosity prompted him to make.
I knew nothing of the objects for which the
Embassy had been sent to the Court of Shoa; at
least nothing beyond what might naturally be
supposed—such as the extension of our commerce,
and the establishment of friendly relations with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
native princes; farther than this I was quite
ignorant of the purposes for which our Government
had sent political agents into Abyssinia.
To learn this, was evidently the chief object
that Bethlehem had in view, during our long conversation;
but I think he went away with an
impression, that I knew nothing about it, and that
the assumed mystery of my hints and suggestions
was all affectation to make him believe that my
information upon the subject was very valuable
indeed. If so, I had reason to be very glad; for
after this interview, no political questions were
ever asked me by any of the agents of the Negoos;
and he himself, during the interview the next day
but one, confined himself entirely to matters connected
solely with the improvements and arts, that
my education would enable me to introduce a knowledge
of among his subjects.</p>

<p>I sat all the next morning expecting the summons
for me to go up to the palace, but no
messenger appearing, and symptoms of the approach
of my fever fit coming on, I sent Walderheros to
Bethlehem, to represent to the Negoos, the impossibility
of my going to the palace that day, and to
ask for an interview early the next morning, that
I might leave Ankobar immediately after, for
it was impossible that I could exist many days in
that city.</p>

<p>Oh, the weather in Ankobar! To look out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
Musculo’s house was like looking into a boiling-house
in a brewery, which I presume is always full
of steam. But was it warm? had it that dryness
which even the vapour of hot water may be said to
have? No; by heavens! for the atmosphere was
one heavy drizzling perpetual Scotch mist, whilst
the earth beneath was one rich surface of sloppy
greasy mud. No life seemed stirring, except occasionally,
when some closely wrapped-up figure came
like a ghost emerging from a cloud, and jumping
under the thatched roof, threw off his thick cotton
<i>legumbigalla</i>, and stamping the dirt and wet off
his feet and legs, loudly expostulated with the wet
season for bringing such inconveniences with its
rain.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Tinta came down with his
Court train of servants, to see me at Musculo’s
house. I happened just then to be lying under
the influence of the ague fit, so he only remained
to express his sorrow at seeing me in such a condition,
and promised that he would ask the Negoos
to receive me early in the morning, that I might
not be detained any longer in Ankobar than was
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>During this stay at Musculo’s house, I observed
the tattooing process by which the Shoan ladies
disfigure their faces with large artificial eyebrows
of a black colour; for nearly the whole day was
occupied by Eichess ornamenting in this manner,
the broadly round face of her fat slave-girl,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
Mahriam. It appeared to be no joke, although, if
a ridiculous absurdity could have suspended my
predisposition to the fever paroxysm, it would have
been this beautifying operation. The whole year previously,
every depilatory means by which to eradicate
the natural hairs of the eyebrows had been
employed, and the pertinacious industry with which
this had been done, I noticed on my previous visit
had occasioned an expression of vacuity that was
not at all wanted in the ever-smiling expanse of
countenance which Mahriam displayed over a bust,
breast, and body, so large and fat, that darkened the
house immediately if she stood a moment in the
wide door-way. One half of the right eye-brow had
been done two or three days previously, a very
promising dry scab of charcoal and the natural
secretion consequent upon a sore had formed, and
which was looked at by Eichess with all the
interest that a mother may be supposed to examine
the progress of the virus influence upon her
recently vaccinated child. In a word, it was
pronounced to be promising very well, and
the instruments and dye were then produced to
finish the business. Eichess sat upon a boss of
straw, and Mahriam knelt down before her, whilst
Walderheros, to encourage the latter to bear the pain
with fortitude, told her to be sure and recollect she
was a <em>man</em>. A bundle of long white thorns, which
I recognised as belonging to the commonest kind
of mimosa, were now taken from a rag in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
they were folded, and one being selected, Eichess
commenced with it a dotting kind of puncturing
in the skin, along a semicircular line, previously
marked with a piece of charcoal around the frontal
edge of the orbit, and which, besides including the
bald part of the original eyebrow, was prolonged considerably
towards the lower part of the temple, and
also extended to the middle of the space between
the eyes, where it met the similar delineation coming
from the other side. Blood soon flowed freely, and
I could scarcely have imagined it possible that such
a punishment could be sustained for the attainment
of so unnatural an ornament. Custom must constitute
the principal part of original sin, or such
barbarous attempts as these to improve upon
nature would not be persisted in from one generation
to another. The ladies of antiquity, I recollect
learning when I was a student, employed a black
mineral, <i>stibium</i>, supposed to be <i>plumbago</i>, or black
lead; for the purpose, says Celsus, of making them
black browed, and this fashion, with many others,
appears to have been early introduced in to Abyssinia,
either by the Greeks or Romans, and has been
continued in that country to the present day. The
manner in which a lady of fashion dresses her hair
in Shoa, in a series of close pipe-like curls, is
identically the same with the head-dress represented
in the bust of Octavia, the niece of Augustus,
in the British Museum, (Chamber vi. No. 65,) and
I should require no other woodcut to illustrate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
this Abyssinian fashion than a drawing of that
bust.</p>

<p>After the painful process had concluded as
regarded one eyebrow, a mixture of powdered
charcoal and water was made, and a little rag
being first dipped into this was then rubbed over
the fresh wound, until a sufficient quantity of the
blacking dye had become absorbed, when the blood
was washed from her face, and Mahriam was complimented
by all for her fortitude and improved
appearance. With the most simple gratitude the
well-pleased girl stoops and kisses, with an affectionate
obeisance, the hand of her indulgent
mistress.</p>

<p>A similar operation is sometimes performed over
the front part of the gums, and upon the inner
surface of the lips, where I should conceive the most
excruciating pain must be occasioned by the process.
What girls will suffer for the sake of gaining
admiration is most astonishing; but, however, they
are not all so silly as this in Shoa, for, in justice to
the Tabeeb women, I must observe that this custom
is not practised among them, and the consequence
is, that the younger females of this very singular
people, are the handsomest in the country. In
addition to the tattooed eyebrows it is not unusual
to observe the figure of a Geez letter ጠ, which I am
told is a very ancient Egyptian symbol expressive of
the unity of the Deity. All idea of this signification
is lost, but the Abyssinians account for the employment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
of this mark upon the forehead because it is
said to exert a very benign influence upon the
bearer. Besides the physical appearances which
led me to consider that the Christians of the
Malabar coast of India I have seen, were emigrants
from Southern Abyssinia, was the circumstance
of this very symbol being tattooed between the
eyebrows in exactly the same manner as it is borne
by the Shoan women.</p>

<p>Before nine o’clock the next day a message came
down from the palace for me to attend upon the
Negoos, and although my shoes let in water and
even mud very freely, and the drizzling fog
threatened soon to wet me to my skin, I took the long
<i>zank</i> which was given me to assist in the ascent up
the steep hill, and I started with the desperation of
a man who had given up all hopes of ever being
permitted to dismount again from death’s grey
steed, disease, which, at a hard trot, for nearly the last
two years, had been carrying me towards the grave.</p>

<p>The palace of Ankobar lifts its thatched roofs
above the summit of a high pyramidal hill, the
abrupt termination of the narrow spur-like ridge
upon which Ankobar stands. Three sides are
singularly regular, and appear as if cut into an
angular pyramidal cone, that rises two or three
hundred feet above the level of the ridge to which
it is connected on the fourth side. A high stockade
of splintered <i>ted</i> winds spirally from midway,
to the last enclosure upon the top of the hill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
wherein stand the royal buildings. The lower
portion of the palisades skirt for some distance the
road into Ankobar from the valley of the Airahra,
and the first house upon the elevated ridge may be
said to be the palace, for its large and rudely-formed
wooden gates on the left hand, are the first
doorway perceived by the weary traveller after
having ascended to the level of the town.</p>

<p>If, however, he look over the precipices to the right,
the whole way up, he will perceive hundreds of the
thatched roofs of little circular houses, in which
the greater number of the Royal slaves and servants
reside with their families. These descend by a
quick succession of little gardened terraces to the
meadow-like but limited plateau that intervenes
some distance, before the actual bed of the Airahra
river is gained. If the traveller looks from his
elevated position in this direction, and if it be a
bright day, a splendid prospect extends before
him. Houses, the straw tops of which he could
jump down upon, so steep is the descent, conceal
the view of those which are immediately below;
but jutting beyond these, fringe-like enclosures
of the thick foliage of the <i>shokoko-gwoman</i> and
the <i>amharara</i> trees, and low-thatched roofs buried
in gardens of the broad-leaved <i>ensete</i> or <i>koba</i>
banana plant, appear, falling rapidly to the undulating
broad meadow, studded with numerous
little eminences, where solitary, but snug-looking
farmhouses are sheltered by tall flat-topped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
mimosas or the pine-like growing ted. Partial
glimpses, of the winding Airahra beyond; here,
where it meanders sluggishly through a verdant
mead, or there, where a silver column marks a
distant fall; the opposite grey cliffs of the Tchakkah
range, dotted with dark green clumps of the huge
crimson-flowering <i>cosso</i>, all aid in filling up the background
of a picture of real beauty and of apparent
peace, upon which the eye and mind can dwell
for hours untired, contemplating with a pleased
sympathy of delight, upon a scene that appears so
adapted for a practical experiment of Utopian colonization,
the object of which should be the fullest
development of human happiness and excellence.</p>

<p>I did not stop to-day, except when violent palpitation
of the heart and the greatest oppression in
breathing obliged me to come to a stand to recover
myself after climbing up some stairs formed of the
trunks of trees, that placed me upon a level
position or landing-place; several of which aids in
the steep ascent, characterize the King’s highway
into Ankobar. Leaning upon Walderheros, I
turned under the arch-way of the first gate, and
passed through a narrow court, or partition,
between two succeeding enclosures. Then beneath
another gate-house, over which the clanking of
chains needed no interpretation from my servant
that it was the Royal prison for the temporary
confinement of culprits. In the sheltered passage
thus formed, I sat upon a huge stone to rest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
whilst a long string of donkeys descended, coming
from the storehouses above, where they had been
delivering grain and berberah for the use of
the palace. A long irregular series of wooden
steps in a winding curve along the side of the
hill, brought us to the last enclosure upon
the summit. Here a little wicket leads to a high
terrace-walk, having on one side a long row of
palisades, and on the other, a clear and open view
of the broad and deep valley of the Airahra, whilst
before the visitor, stands a rude stone arch, but of
what character, its architect, Demetrius, would be
at a loss to say; this occupies the whole width of
the terrace-walk, or about eighteen feet wide, and is
from twelve to fifteen feet high. The gateway is
about six feet wide and about nine feet high, and
is closed by one large door, in which a lesser one
for ordinary purposes is cut. After staying a short
time in a little shed near the first wicket, and
in which the porter is sheltered from the weather,
Tinta appeared at the gate of Demetrius, and
called me to come immediately, and in a very
few moments I was introduced into a small room,
where, upon a raised iron hearth, a good fire was
burning. Here, on his usual throne, a white cloth
covered alga, the Negoos was reclining, and in
close conversation with the monk Bethlehem, who,
sitting cross-legged on an ox-skin below, seemed to
have been giving his opinion upon four or five
rifles that lay before him upon the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
After the usual salutations were made, and an
ox-skin had been spread for me, Walderheros, Tinta,
and other attendants who had accompanied me into
the room, were ordered to withdraw, and I began
to suspect some political matters were to be the topic
of our conversation. “Kaffu wobar,” (fevers are bad
things,) said the monarch, which Bethlehem translated
rather unnecessarily, but it commenced my
examination as to the relative merits of gun-barrels.
I had to describe how they were manufactured;
what was the differences between the plain and
twisted; in what manner the grooves on the rifle
were made; and whether long or short barrels
were most economical for service. As regarded
the latter query, the monarch showed his quickness
in detecting any anomaly, or apparent contradiction;
for having before asserted that the best gun he had
showed me to-day was a strong two-ounce rifle,
double-barreled, I said that the long Arab matchlock
barrel was most inconvenient by reason of its
great weight, when he instantly took the rifle and
placed it in my hands, to show me that it was at
least twice the weight of the one I now contemned.</p>

<p>From guns the conversation changed to the subject
of dyes, which appeared to be of the next
importance in the mind of Sahale Selassee. The
scarlet colour of our country I told him required not
vegetables for its production, but either insects or
minerals; and I suppose Bethlehem had previously
explained this to him, as he seemed satisfied with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
my statement without farther question. Indigo, I
was able to promise him that I would undertake
to cultivate, and make serviceable to his people by
teaching them how to manufacture the dye, if that
I recovered my health after the rains subsided, and
which it was expected they would in the middle of
this month (September). He inquired very particularly
into the process, and I explained it to
him as well as I could, and he complimented me
by saying, that my services in thus extending a
knowledge of useful arts among his children (subjects)
would be of more value than all the rich
gifts that had been brought to him by the commander
(our ambassador). I was then asked for
some medicine for his brother who was sick, Bethlehem
interpreting the whole conversation that took
place upon this subject.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> Major Harris, in his “Highlands of Ethiopia,” has made the
following assertions:—“In utter abhorrence of the country and
its inhabitants, the Moslem servants who accompanied the Embassy
from India all took their departure, willing to brave the dangers
and difficulties of a long journey through the inhospitable deserts
of Adaîel, rather than prolong a hateful sojourn in Abyssinia. One
half of the number were murdered on their way down, and the
places of all long remained empty.” This is most unjust both to the
Dankalli and the Abyssinian, for of the twenty native and Arab servants,
independent of the two tent Lascars mentioned as having
accompanied the Mission, eight only were dismissed in Shoa—Sultaun,
Hadjji Abdullah, Allee Chous, Berberah Allee, Abbas, Mahudee,
Hadjji Ohmed, and an Indian boy, whose name I have forgotten.
These servants had been led to expect, on their arrival in Abyssinia,
the payment of the high wages which, in some of their cases, had
alone induced them to accompany the Mission through Adal. Their
disappointment may be conceived when they were then informed that
a moiety only of their wages would be paid to them in Shoa, and that
the remainder would run on in arrears until their return to Aden.
This injustice, as it was conceived to be, was resented, and the
discharge of these eight, in this remote country, was the consequence.
The unfortunate servants appealed to the Negoos for
redress, who condescended (but without avail) to intercede for their
return to the Mission. This affront to the royal dignity was
never forgotten, whilst a very injurious prejudice was raised by the
conduct that was pursued by our representative with reference to
the non-performance of the engagements entered into with these
men. This being followed shortly afterwards by the infliction of
corporeal punishment upon a soldier for a breach of martial law,
when no other kind of discipline was even pretended to be kept up,
astonished the Abyssinians not a little, and gave the finishing
blow to all popular respect for English civilization, or wishes for
any connexion whatever with our country.</p>

<p class="footnote">But this is not all. Of the eight discharged servants, instead
of the whole of these men showing any abhorrence of the country,
the greater part of them took to themselves wives, and upon what
little they had saved lived near me in Aliu Amba. Three of them
however (Hadjji Ohmed, Mahudee, and the Indian boy), were
induced to attempt a passage to the sea-coast. The Kafilah they
accompanied was attacked on the eastern bank of the Hawash by
the Takalee tribe. The Indian boy was slain, but Hadjji Ohmed
and Mahudee, being mounted, fled different ways; the former
fortunately found protection and shelter for more than a month
with Omah Batta’s sub-division of the Sidee Ahbreu tribe, whilst
Mahudee contrived to reach a much more distant portion of Adal,
the country of Chur-Chur, on the road to Hurrah from Shoa. Here
he also remained several weeks, receiving the greatest attention
and kindness, and finally was restored, as was also Hadjji Ohmed,
to the <i>Negoos</i> of Shoa, who rewarded their <i>Adal</i> entertainers for
their hospitality to British subjects.</p>

<p class="footnote">It may be naturally supposed that the author of the “Highlands
of Ethiopia” was ignorant of these facts, but this is impossible,
for Mahudee, who had visited Chur-Chur, was reinstated in his
situation as horsekeeper to Major Harris himself, in return for the
interesting information it was supposed he could give of the little-known
country where he had been living.</p>

</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A very</span> singular circumstance connected with our
conversation respecting the health of the brother
of the Negoos was, that neither Bethlehem or
myself recollected at first, that all the near relations
of Sahale Selassee were incarcerated in prison,
according to ancient Abyssinian custom, and which,
I believe, was also practised in the kingdom of
Judea, to secure, by this cruel policy, the monarch
from personal danger, and the country from the
evils inflicted by civil war, that might otherwise
arise by the ambition or simplicity of the other
branches of the Royal family, either acting itself or
admitting of being acted upon by the arts of others.</p>

<p>The Shoan prison for these unfortunates is a
high conical hill, called Guancho, situated midway
between Aliu Amba and Farree, and is the
residence of the Wallasmah Mahomed, who fills
the office of State gaoler, as well as collector of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
duties upon that frontier of the kingdom. Here,
at the period of this interview with the King, were
confined five princes of the blood Royal, some of
whom had been prisoners for as many as thirty, or
thirty-four years.</p>

<p>From personal inspection of their apartments,
an opportunity afforded to no other European
besides, I can state that the close and rigorous
confinement, said to have been imposed upon
these captives, is much exaggerated; and, although
the separate sleeping apartments at night were
not more than seven feet in all their dimensions,
still they were only composed of sticks, such
as the common garden rods for raising peas in
England, and a strong man leaning hard against
them must have fallen out through the wall of
his cell. Only two of the royal prisoners wore
chains; these were on one hand and leg of the
same side, and were long enough to admit of the
freest motion. A long-thatched <i>wort bait</i>, or meat-house,
contained their families; for not only did the
King remember his captive brethren on days of
festival, by sending them oxen, and honey-wine,
but they were allowed to marry, and their wives
lived with them in their confinement. I took a
ground plan of the whole establishment, and the
Wallasmah, who was too old to accompany me on
my survey, when I was in the only place that
looked like a dungeon at all, a vault about twenty
feet square, cut out of the summit of the hill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
stamped several times upon the roof to intimate
that his sitting-room was over this secure place. In
this dismal dungeon, however, no person had been
confined for the last six or seven years, although it
was being then prepared, by a second door being
put up, for the occupation of the unfortunate
Samma-negoos, an ex-frontier governor, who had
assisted his brother, a denounced rebel, to escape to
Argobba, where he is now entertained by the
Mahomedan Prince of that country, Beroo Lobo.
When I visited Guancho, this prisoner occupied a
small den of sticks, not four feet wide in any
direction, and his hands and feet were chained
close together, so that his removal to the larger
subterranean cell will, at all events, afford him
some opportunities of exercise, though he will
then be deprived of light and fresh air.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, the Royal prisoners did not
enjoy life in a valley of delight, they certainly did
not drag out a miserable existence upon the hill of
despair. This would have been adding unnecessary
cruelty to an exigency of State policy; an evil that
would, I am convinced, have long before corrected
itself, by the frequent escapes that would have been
attempted, especially in a place that afforded such
opportunities for obtaining personal freedom. An
Abyssinian Baron Trenck would only have to wrench
open the thin bar of soft iron which constitutes
fetters in that country, and by three successive jumps
through, not over, as many fences of rotten sticks,
he would be as free as the wildest Galla, into whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
country a walk of a few hours would take
him. I did not show any lucifer matches, for I
recollected that the Portuguese traveller Bermudez,
had been confined in this very prison, and I did
not know whether an act of incendiarism might not
at a future time be available as a means of escape;
for, it must be understood, at the time of this visit
I had been threatened if I attempted to leave
Shoa with the Embassy on their return to Aden,
to be confined in Guancho, so desirous was the
Negoos of detaining me with him.</p>

<p>Guancho, the State prisoners, nor the anxiety of
his Majesty that I should remain in his service, can
be entered into now; this is anticipating the occurrence
of events, the relation of which must be
excused from the increasing contraction of my
limits, that prevents me from holding but a little
more pleasant converse with my reader, who, I
hope, so far has been conducted with an amused
interest through the scenes of Dankalli and Abyssinia
life, in which I was a participator during my
sojourn in those countries.</p>

<p>Recalled to a recollection of the circumstances of
the condition of the Royal relations, by a remark of
the Negoos, Bethlehem turned to me, and commented
upon the sanitary observances I had been
recommending for the benefit of my supposed
patient, as he was a prisoner, and I then learnt,
that the Negoos was consulting me upon the subject
of a disease, to which he was himself subject. The
symptoms that he had detailed plainly indicated a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
great determination of blood to the head, and
among other things which I had suggested as preventives
of the occasional giddiness, dimness of
sight, &amp;c., which was complained of, was frequent
exercise by walking, and recommended that this
should be for some distance regularly every
morning and evening. It was this which had led
the Negoos to make some playful remark in his
character, as his brother’s representative, that this
indeed would be a pleasant medicine for him, and
which reminded the interpreter that if I went on
prescribing in that way I might say something
unpleasant to the Royal ear. Perhaps the unconscious
shrug, with which I acknowledged our error
operated upon the mind of the monarch more than
any direct appeal that I could have made in favour
of his unhappy relatives, and expressed more real
sorrow than the cold interpretation of Bethlehem
could have conveyed.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The monarch soon after changed the subject by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
alluding to the bad state of my own health, and of
the necessity of my remaining quiet in Aliu Amba
until the termination of the wet season, which was
expected about the middle of the present month.
He did not forget to recommend to me the study
of the Amharic language during that time, so that
in the next expedition against the Galla, to which
he had already invited me, I might be able to converse
with him. The Negoos did not detain me much
longer, but after telling me not to miss seeing the
Muscal (at Debra Berhan on the 24th), if it
were possible for me to come, he dismissed me,
glad enough to escape from the fatiguing interview.</p>

<p>I returned to Musculo’s house a great deal too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
tired to think of going on to Aliu Amba directly,
but made up my mind to stay until an hour or two
before sunset, to arrive in that town just in time
for bed, and so escape the houseful of inquiring
friends, who would have thronged around me with
compliments and congratulations on my return.</p>

<p>To amuse me some portion of the time, Musculo
introduced three of four slaves who had been
brought from the more interesting countries around
Shoa, and none of whom, as regards their political
relations with that country, demand a more particular
notice than the Gallas. These appear to
surround Shoa on every side, except towards the
north, where the Amhara inhabitants of the
Argobba appear to have their country in that
direction, continuous with the Shoan province of
Efat; but even here a narrow belt of debateable
land, by the mutual jealousies of the rulers of the
two kingdoms, is left to the undisputed possession
of some unsettled Adal Galla tribes.</p>

<p>I have several times, in the body of this work,
represented these people as being the mixed descendants
of the Dankalli and Shankalli people, and
although this descent has been modified in some
situations by contiguity to nations differing very considerably,
both physically and morally, from each
other, still all the numerous tribes that stretch on
the eastern side of the table land of Abyssinia,
from the neighbourhood of Massoah to an unknown
distance in the south, speak one language, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
practise nearly similar customs. The first disputed
question respecting the Gallas is their origin,
which is generally supposed to be foreign to the
continent they now occupy, and from the name <i>Calla</i>
resembling a Hebrew word signifying milk, it has
been presumed that they were a white people of that
nation, who have become changed in colour by a long
residence in their present inter-tropical possessions.
Modern travellers continue in supporting this supposition,
but in recording my dissent I ask no one
to adopt my opinion, I owe it to my readers to state
my ideas upon a subject I have studied a little, and
upon which I presume they require information.
It is not, therefore, to attract attention by opposing
received opinion, which I would much rather
avoid, but for the sake of exciting discussion
among abler men than myself, that I here throw
out suggestions respecting the Gallas, as on other
subjects I have done before.</p>

<p>The origin of the name Galla, from the Arian
word <i>calla</i>, black, appears easy and natural, and I
have therefore adopted it, but shall feel greatly
indebted to any learned ethnologist who will correct
me if I am in error. The country their presumed
parents occupied, is that in which, from its situation,
no other complexioned people could reside, whilst
that law of nature continues to exist which has
imposed a black skin upon men living in a very
hot country.</p>

<p>We find, however, these so-called blacks in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
geographical situations, quite at variance with that
betokened by the dark colour of their skin, and
more particularly upon the elevated plateau of
Abyssinia, the natural country of the pale yellow
Gonga, where their appearance presents an apparent
anomaly, which, fortunately, history enables
us to explain. The first intrusion of the Amhara I
have in another place endeavoured to show was in
the time of the Egyptian king, Psammeticus, and to
trace their history, in connexion with the changes
consequent upon their colonization of the left banks
of the Abi and the Abiah, would be most easy and
interesting; for the present generation possess
sufficient documentary evidence, to supply the
necessary materials; but until some indefatigable
scholar takes upon himself this task, I have no hope
of seeing that obscurity dispelled which hangs over
the earlier history of mankind, and which is intimately
connected with the earlier history of Abyssinia.
With this part of my subject, however, at present
we have nothing to do, and must call attention to
the fact, that the first recorded appearance of the
Galla in Abyssinia, as hostile invaders, was in 1537,
during the reign of the Emperor David, otherwise
called Onag Segued. By this must be understood
that it was at that time they first found themselves
able to assert their independence. A more favourable
opportunity could not have been afforded them
than that offered, when the Mahomedan King of
Adal, Mahomed Grahne, conquered and overran
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
considerable portions of the ancient empire. To
the distractions and misfortunes that then harassed
the Christian Court the Gallas contributed, led on
by sheer destiny, I believe, for they quietly took
possession with their herds of the countries that had
been devastated during the long civil sectarian war
which, at the time of Grahne, had assumed a
national character from the divisions of the Christian
and Mahomedan Amhara, being then under two
distinct monarchial governments. These two kindred
people mutually destroying each other, were unable
to offer any resistance to the lawless and barbarous
intruders who were alone benefited by the struggle
for supremacy between the professors of these two
faiths.</p>

<p>The Adal conquerors, however, lost a great
deal more by the war than the defeated Christians
of the table land; for occupying a country of much
less elevation than Abyssinia, the Gallas naturally
located themselves first upon the lands so much
more suited to their habits and constitutions, and
accordingly, the Dankalli, closing from the north,
whilst the Shankalli came up from the south, their
progeny soon swept from the face of the country their
Amhara predecessors; and the red man of America
retreats no faster before civilization, than on this
coast of Africa, the latter has been extinguished by
the advance of the barbarian Gallas. Only one
town remains of the once mighty kingdom of
Adal, the city of Hurrah, the former capital of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
Mahomed Grahne, before whose time Christianity
was here at least tolerated and professed
by numbers of its inhabitants. Within the last
century another lingering remnant of this population
of Adal has been entirely driven out.
Owssa, now exclusively Mahomedan Dankalli,
was formerly the capital of Amhara kings of
Adal, and the traditions of the present occupiers
record the late residence in that country of a Christian
population. After the death of Mahomed
Grahne and the expulsion of the Jesuits from
Abyssinia, the attention of its princes was
first directed to the increasing evil of Galla
intrusion, and they then endeavoured unsuccessfully,
to recover those portions of the table-land
upon which they had established themselves.</p>

<p>It is admitted that the Gallas entered Abyssinia,
through the natural breach in its surrounding
rampart on the east, where the denuding
operation of the Hawash has constructed a favourable
high road for the journeyings of a nation.
Had a similar facility existed to the south, such as
would be afforded, for example, by the débouché,
of a river from the table land in that situation, we
may be assured that the national integrity of the
Gonga people, who, in the north, were unable to
contend against the intruding Amhara, would have
found it very difficult to contend with the more
warlike Galla; yet who, it will be found, have made
less impression there than in any other situation
upon the whole table land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
It appears that Fatagar, Efat, Shoa, then Damot,
(which at that period extended to the south of the
river Abi,) were successively taken possession of, a
succession of conquests which prove that the course
of the Hawash, was the principal natural direction
this people took in their wanderings.</p>

<p>In Shoa and Efat they appear to have been early
civilized. One of the most characteristic traits of the
Galla people is, the facility with which they appear to
adopt the religious creeds of their neighbours; and
the adjoining kingdom of Amhara, the central
stronghold of the Christian religion, afforded
numerous opportunities of conversion, and perhaps
other favourable circumstances then existed of
which we are now ignorant; but the result has
been a closer amalgamation of the Gallas with the
Amhara people in Shoa than, I believe, any other
country of Abyssinia presents. Whilst, therefore,
an exceedingly corrupt dialect of the Amharic
language is there spoken, the dark colour of their
skin attests their close consanguinity with the Galla
invaders, coming from the low hot country immediately
at the foot of the Abyssinian scarp in this
situation.</p>

<p>The Galla, physically speaking, are a fine race
of men, tall, muscular, and well formed. In the
colour of their skin they vary considerably, as may
be supposed, from the differences of situation and
of neighbourhood in which they have located
themselves. The Edjow Gallas, to the north of
Angotcha, are, I understand, of a lighter colour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
than the real Amhara or red man, but it is
probable that some mistake exists as regards this
statement. The Gallas of Limmoo are very dark-coloured,
but they live in a country considerably
more elevated than that of the Edjow Gallas.
The Shoans themselves, who are considerably more
Galla than Amhara, are a very dark brown,
although several light red individuals, not born in
Shoa, but more to the north, as I was told by Sheik
Tigh, are to be found among them.</p>

<p>In the expression of the Galla countenance there is
that which reminds the observer more of their Shankalli
than of their Dankalli origin. The form of
their heads is long, the sides being flat, with very
contracted but not receding foreheads. The lower
parts of their faces have the full negro-form
development of the lips and jaws, although the
teeth are regular and well set, without the inclination
forwards I have observed in several negro
skulls. Their hair is coarse and frizzly. It is
generally worn in long narrow plaits, that hang
directly down upon the neck and shoulders. In
Shoa it is customary to dress it with considerable
care, and it is then sometimes arranged in most
fantastic forms, the head being adorned all over
with numerous small collected tufts, and at
others, three monstrous heaps of hair on the sides
and top make the head and face look like a huge
ace of clubs. Their natural dispositions are very
good, and their courage is undoubted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
It is very interesting to remark how readily the
Galla appear to adapt their national habits to the
circumstances in which they are placed. This seems
to be a kind of instinct in man, or perhaps is an
element of that moral development which seems
to determine those occasionally mysterious inroads
of a new people, who seem to have sprung up at
once to exert the most extensive changes in the
history of nations, and which then subsides again
for another term of ages. Such was the appearance
of the Mongols in Asia, and of the Goths in
Europe; such was the appearance of the Arabians
after Mahomed; and such are the Gallas of the
present day, who are gradually appropriating to
themselves the whole of the Abyssinian empire. This
moral principle, however, whatever it may be, seems
to promise an abundant harvest of converts to the
zealous and intelligent missionary, who shall first
appear as the professed apostle of Christianity
among them.</p>

<p>Besides the Gallas whom I saw at Musculo’s,
were several Zingero and Kuffah slaves, and as
these are the principal representatives of the
Gonga people, of whom I have frequently spoken,
I shall take this opportunity of more particularly
describing them. The Gongas are a mysterious
people, of whom rumours alone had reached the
civilized world in the remotest antiquity, and the
same obscurity continues at the present time to
hang over this interesting and secluded nation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
With the evidence I collected during my travels in
Abyssinia, it will not be presumption in me to
call attention to a few facts that appear to me calculated
to throw some little light upon this subject,
and which may probably excite a greater desire to
become better acquainted with the hidden secrets
of man’s history contained in the heart of Africa.</p>

<p>The Gongas, in the era of the celebrated Egyptian
king Psammeticus, occupied the whole table-land of
Abyssinia. Neither Amhara, or Galla, had, as yet,
appeared upon their naturally defended and very
extensive fortress. In their social institutions the
great principle of foreign policy, was the exclusion of
strangers; and their isolated situation, easily enabled
them to effect this. One character of civilization, the
geography of the desert-surrounded table-lands of
Africa, is eminently calculated to prosper and promote,
that peculiar social condition, the consistency
and continuance of which, requires little or no
intercourse to be kept up with the rest of mankind;
the isolated members of which, live contented among
themselves, uninfluenced by wants which could
only be gratified by the products of other lands.
In such African communities, no inland seas, or
navigable rivers, afford that facility of intercourse
which is enjoyed (as it is presumed) by the
inhabitants of more highly favoured countries.
Protected also from foreign invasion by vast and
almost impassable deserts, individual enterprize
could scarcely be tempted to keep up a communication
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
with a people so situated, provided that they
adhered to the principles of contentment, and did
not allow themselves to be seduced into a desire for
foreign luxuries; an unwise indulgence in which,
first leads to molestation from commercial intruders;
who, breaking up the seclusion, open a path to
military invasion, which usually ends in the loss
of country and of personal freedom.</p>

<p>We hear of the Gongas in ancient history under
various names, but they were principally characterized
by the cautious manner in which they communicated
with those merchants, with whom nature
imperatively commanded them, at least, to have some
intercourse to exchange the productions of their
country, for what was an absolute necessary of life
to them, and of which they had no supply but from
abroad; I need scarcely mention, that this was salt.
In return for this, it appears, that gold was principally
given to the traders; and for ages, this
commerce was carried on, with no more communication
than was necessary, through the medium of
the following practice. “This country of Sasu is
very rich in gold mines. Every year the King of
Axum sends some of his people to this place for
gold. These are joined by many other merchants;
so that, altogether, they form a caravan of about
five hundred people. They carry with them oxen,
salt, and iron. When they arrive upon the
frontiers of that country they take up their quarters,
and make a large barrier of thorns. In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
meantime having slain and cut up their oxen, they
lay the pieces of flesh, as well as the iron, and
salt, upon the thorns. Then come the inhabitants,
and place one or more parcels of gold upon the
wares, and wait outside the enclosure. The
owners of the flesh, and other goods, then examine
whether this be equal to the price or not. If so,
they take the gold, and the others take the wares;
if not, the latter still add more gold, or take back
what they had already put down. The trade is
carried on in this manner, because the languages
are different, and they have no interpreter; it takes
about five days to dispose of the goods which they
bring with them.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Heeren, in his Historical
Researches, connects the country where this system
of barter was practised, with that of the
Macrobians, or long-lived Ethiopians, mentioned by
Herodotus. By an ingenious conclusion, he supposes
that the altar or table of the Sun which
characterized the latter people was the market-place,
in which, at a later day, the trade with the
strangers was transacted. My observations have
also led me to the same conclusion, but I am able
more distinctly to authenticate this, and to suggest
additional and more direct evidence of its being
the actual fact.</p>

<p>The worship of the Gongas, which has continued
to the present time, is the adoration of the river that
flows through their country, as being part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
sacred Nile. The Abi, or Nile of Bruce, is worshipped
by the modern Adjows, whilst the Gibbee,
or Abiah, is the object of a similar devotion among
the Pagan Gongas of Zingero, and of Kuffah.
We are enabled from our knowledge of the former
river to presume, that its singular course determined
in the first instance, a reverence, which, when the
increasing encroachments of foreign foes had made
this river a convenient defence to the pressed
Gongas, was soon elevated to the character of a
protecting deity. That its singular course should
have thus attracted attention arises, I believe, from
the circumstance of its encircling an extensive
province, and going around it, as the sun was supposed
to revolve around the earth. The zodiac, or
track of the sun through the heavens, was typified
by the form of a serpent, and this I have always
understood to have been the source of that serpent-worship
which characterized so many of the earlier
and more civilized nations of the earth. In no
country, was this idolatry more prevalent than upon
the plateau of Abyssinia, and <i>Arwè</i>, the great
serpent, it will be recollected figures considerably
in the earlier history of the Amhara, who appear
to have in some measure adopted the religion of
the Gongas, when they took possession of the
countries upon the left hand of their <em>father</em>, their
<em>king</em>, their <em>sun</em>, by all of which names, it is usual,
even at the present day, to designate the river Abi.</p>

<p>The great serpents of classic mythological history,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
the Hydra, the Python, and others unnamed,
destroyed by Apollo and Hercules, all allude
evidently to the worship of the serpent in Africa
being superseded by that of the sun. The relation
of these gods to that luminary is generally
admitted, and <i>Hiero Calla</i>, fortunately for my
derivation of the word <i>Galla</i>, the sun of the <em>blacks</em>,
is the interpretative analysis of the name of Hercules.
In the modern Dankalli language no other
word is used for sun but <i>Hiero</i>, and it enters into
the name of several names of places; Hyhilloo,
the scene of the celebrated battle between the
forces of Lohitu and the Muditu, is translated by
the Dankalli to mean the hill of the sun.</p>

<p>The head of a sculptured Hercules is invariably
portraited with the frizzly hair of the Dankalli,
whilst antiquarian ethnologists will be interested to
observe the persistance of national character preserved
in the flowing locks and ample beard usually
given to Jupiter, his European counterpart.</p>

<p>That which increased the celebrity of the northern
portion of the table-land of Abyssinia, and established
the superiority in dignity of its stream, was
the circumstance of its flowing through the lake
Tzana or Dembea. No little light breaks upon the
subject when it is understood, that the literal interpretation
of these two words in very different
languages, is the same, both signifying the lake of
the sun. Dembea, let me observe, is a word in
use in Abyssinia that belongs to the same language
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
as <i>Abi</i>, <i>Assa</i>, <i>Galla</i>, <i>Nil</i>, and others, that to avoid
confusion, I have called <i>Arian</i>. That so many
proper names, should all be derived from an
Asiatic language in a country where no representatives
of the modern people who speak it can now
be found, is only to be accounted for, by supposing
that the African original of the Arian family of
man yet continues in some of the secluded oases of
Intra-tropical Africa, to reward by their discovery
future enterprize.</p>

<p>Bahr Dembea, or the Lake of the Sun, would
give a very appropriate designation to the plateau
upon which it is found. It was that, and the
course of the Abi, which occasioned the country
visited by the messengers of Cambyses to be called
the Table of the Sun. It was also the presence
of these singularly situated geographical features,
and their supposed reference to the sun’s track in
the zodiac, that determined the reputed sanctity of
this portion of Ethiopia in the classic ages.</p>

<p>The connexion of the ancient Persian empire
with its Ethiopic tributary kingdoms, did not extend
so far as the country of Sasu, and the fate of Cambyses,
in his attempted conquest of that country,
would be, I have no doubt, an instructive lesson to
his successors. The claims of these monarchs to
supremacy in Ethiopia appears, in fact, to have
been founded upon former family connexion with
some father-land in Africa, not situated upon the
plateau of Abyssinia, then inhabited by the Gongas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
but in another desert-surrounded country, of the
same character; probably, that which surrounds the
sources of the Bahr ul Abiad.</p>

<p>The African origin of other ancient nations
can also be most easily demonstrated, and the
historical accounts of their descent from gods,
which have come down to us, although they
consist of exaggerated and distorted relations,
in consequence of having been derived from the
ignorant translation of hieroglyphical records, in
which it would appear that the earlier history of
Africa was preserved; still we are able to gather
from these mythological enigmas everything that is
necessary to connect their origin with a common
centre of divergence, which I believe to have
been the country around the sources of the Nile.</p>

<p>In the same manner the worship of the rivers in
India, and of the dragon monster in China, seem
to have originated from Ethiopia; the emigration
which carried the first colonies of serpent worshippers
to these countries having probably flowed in a direction
from the south, as Europe and Western Asia
appear to have been civilized by colonists from the
north of the same point of dispersion.</p>

<p>It is most interesting to trace the intimate connexion
at an early period of the, at present, widely
separated and even physically distinct varieties of
man; and did not a cautious policy restrain me, I
would attempt to demonstrate the original unity of
nations now the most dissimilar upon novel evidence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
which, to be satisfactory to others, must, however,
receive farther corroboration than my own individual
observations.</p>

<p>One illustration of the light African explorations
promise to throw upon this subject I cannot refrain
from advancing, as it is such a striking evidence of
the presumed fact of even ourselves having originated
from a colony of African emigrants; and that the
ancient British temple of <i>Abury</i>, or <i>Abibury</i>, near
Stonehenge, derived its name from the same
religious worship being there celebrated as was once
general on the plateau of <i>Abyssinia</i>, and which, in
fact, is so called from exactly the same cause. The
deductions of classical learning materially assist a
traveller, whose pursuits, so different to a closet
student, do not allow him to assume the character
of a learned critic or commentator. Dr. Stukeley,
known by his inquiries into the ancient religion of
the Druids, has proved, I think incontestably, the
true character of the temple at <i>Abibury</i>, and
demonstrates it to have been constructed in the
form of a serpent, bearing upon its back a circle.
He referred the religion, that directed such a
form to be assumed in the sacred architecture
of this people, to an Egyptian origin, and
freely speculates, in consequence, upon the African
origin of our ancestors, which is asserted by our
most ancient historians, but who have been in
consequence considered to be apocryphal. In these
traditions it is affirmed that Britain was first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
inhabited by a celebrated descendant of Shem, singularly
enough the same, who is considered by
biblical ethnologists to have been the common
father of no less a respectable people, than the
modern Dankalli; Affer, the son of Abraham, having
led a colony of Africans to our shores, where he
introduced the worship of the sun, and established
the religion of Druidism. I recommend to
my reader the perusal of Stukley’s work upon
“Abury, a Temple of the Ancient Britons,” and
then to compare the parallel, but more magnificent
temple of nature upon the plateau of Abyssinia,
where the <i>serpent Arwè</i>, or in profane language
the river Abi, bears upon its back the lake of the
<em>sun</em>, most curiously identifying the peculiar worship
of that luminary by the ancient Ethiopians with the
same adoration which was professed by the Druids
in Britain, but who, from their situation, were
obliged to construct the winding avenue of stones
at Abibury to represent the same mystical hieroglyphic
of the serpent and the sun. The name
given to this work was <i>Abi</i>, the <i>father</i>, or <i>king</i>, as
it was also of the river-symbol in Abyssinia; hence
the name <i>Abibury</i>, the latter portion of which
word is of Saxon origin; and added, subsequently
to the decline of Druidism.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

Returning to the Gongas and their connexion
with the Sasu of Cosmas, it is singular to observe
in what manner the seclusive integrity of that
country was first sapped, and then in a great
measure overthrown. Within the last two centuries,
the Adjows of Northern Abyssinia, the
representatives of the Gongas in that situation,
were said to continue the original practice of their
fathers with respect to commercial transactions.
But these must have been a tribe now extinct,
as, from what I can learn, it is only in the extreme
south where the custom is still persisted in, and it
is among these that the most ancient authentic
record (uninspired) of the antediluvian world will
be found. It is here, too, that the original name
of this people, Sasu, is preserved in the modern
word Susa, of whom, as a nation, we scarcely
possess any information more than sufficient, to
warrant the mere assertion that such a people
now exist highly civilized, and using a peculiar
written character dissimilar to any with which the
literati of Europe are acquainted.</p>

<p>Of the Sasu traders in the time of Cosmas,
we are told they carried with them oxen which,
on their arrival in the country, they killed, and
hung up the raw flesh on the thorns, as a kind
of merchandise. It will be remembered that I have
previously stated the intoxicating effects of this kind
of food upon the Amhara, and I have therefore no
difficulty in supposing that the Gongas were tempted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
by this kind of dissipation into the intercourse with
the traders, just as in modern times, “fire water”
for Indians, and opium for the Chinese are employed
to effect a similar object. This receives
further confirmation from the fact, that the secluded
Gongas of the present day live entirely upon vegetables,
the ensete plant and grain forming the
principal food. In Zingero and Enarea, broken in
upon by the Mahomedan and Christian religions,
the inhabitants have adopted the use of animal food,
but even among them a party of the older faith
exists who continue the original mode of living of
their fathers, and who are contemptuously styled,
for that reason, “grain eaters.”</p>

<p>The Gongas that I have seen are of short stature,
not exceeding five feet four inches, are delicately
made, and of a pale yellow complexion. The
aperture of the eyelid in some were quite straight,
but in others it was obliquely divided. Their hair
was straight and strong. A triangular formed face,
the forehead being low and long, and the chins very
pointed. I could not convince myself, as I looked
at their whole appearance, but that they were of
the same race as the Hottentots of the Cape,
differing only in so much as that the latter are
in a very degraded state. Many remarkable
customs practised by both nations could not have
been merely coincidental; and one, that of voluntary
semi-emasculation, is too extraordinary not
to be referred to the same origin of imposition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
Of the identity of the two people there can be
no doubt, and there is no ethnological fact I
observed during my journey of which I am so well
satisfied as this.</p>

<p>The remains of this interesting people in
Northern Abyssinia are the Adjows and the
Falasha, and if future travellers will expend their
resources in exploring Northern Abyssinia, in
preference to the far more important examination
of its southern portion, they cannot occupy themselves
more advantageously to science than by
examining into the customs and characters of the
Adjows. I consider it would be a waste of time
that could be occupied much better in another direction,
or I would, for my own satisfaction, visit the
country for this purpose; but as it is far from
difficult and constitutes an excellent probationary
journey, I recommend aspirants for fame in the
field of African discovery to make this their trial
excursion.</p>

<p>One more remark upon the Southern Gongas of
Enarea, Zingero, and Kuffah, and I must close this
notice of a very interesting race of man; and that
is to explain the apparent anomaly of their country,
situated at such an elevation above the level of the
sea as I presume it to be, producing cotton and
grapes in profusion.</p>

<p>The observations of that indefatigable and enterprising
traveller, Dr. Beke, has proved that the river
Abi, after flowing a distance of scarcely one hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
and thirty miles, has excavated a valley five or
six thousand feet below the general level of the
table land, whilst the opposite summits of the
bounding sides are distant between thirty and forty
miles. We may look in vain over every portion of
the known world for a similar effect of denudation,
and this again illustrates the wide field of novel
facts which is promised to science, by an examination
of the unknown interior of Africa.</p>

<p>On the artificial terraces and natural slopes of
these extensive valleys the vegetables of all climates
can be successfully cultivated, and the
theoretical centre of successive elevations from
whence, according to the hypothesis of Linnæus, all
vegetation spread over the rest of the earth, appears
to exist in the natural phenomena presented, by
the surface geography of the Abyssinian table
mountain. The country of the Gongas is similarly
excavated by the deeply cut channel of the Gibbee,
or the Red Nile, which, much larger than the Abi
on the northern portion of the plateau, will have a
greater extent of denuded valley for the production
of those vegetables of a hot climate, the presence
of which have been such an argument in favour of
those, who contend that the water-shed of the
Gibbee must be towards the lowlands in the
South, where it is presumed these vegetables could
only have been cultivated.</p>

<p>The other slaves I examined at Musculo’s, were
a few Amhara from Gurague, but who contributed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
but little to my previous information, upon the
subject of their character and country. I noticed
there were no Dankalli among those brought
down for my inspection; and was given to understand
that none of these people were ever brought
into Abyssinia as slaves; and if they were, no one
would purchase them, for they would neither
remain with their masters, nor would they
work. Even in this, their true Circassian origin
is betrayed; for, although their morality does not
prevent them from selling their own daughters,
this caste of mankind cannot be enslaved. The
superiority of this mentally endowed race is
manifest, even in their most barbarous state; and
I have been led, therefore, to disbelieve the
general presumption, that the Negro is universally
the type of man in his most degraded
condition. From what I have observed myself,
the Dankalli, the Shankalli, and the Bushmen,
are the lowest grades of the three varieties
of the human race, the Arian, or Circassian, the
Amhara, or Negro, and the Gonga, or Mongolian,
all of whom have a height of civilization, and a
depth of barbarism distinct from each other; and
that, however, the Bushman may be improved, he
will only become a civilized Chinese, and that a
Negro may by education be made an ancient Egyptian,
but would never by that alone become the
enlightened Circassian, that his neighbour, the
Dankalli, could, certainly, be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
I have now exhausted, not my subject, the
numerous ideas upon which I have latterly been
most inconveniently obliged to crowd together, but
the very limited space that I had proposed to
myself in my ignorance of book-making, as being
sufficient to contain all I had to say respecting my
journey, and the ideas and incidents which occurred
to me during my sojourn in Abyssinia. Much
to my surprise, the manuscript has grown under my
hand, and the greatest difficulty that I have had, has
been to arrive at the period I have done, before I
laid down the pen.</p>

<p>From this date, however, September the 3rd,
having returned to Aliu Amba, from Ankobar, I
was confined some time entirely to my bed, during
which period my note-book presents such a series of
entries, “no better to-day,” that I have taken the
opportunity thus afforded me of concluding my
narrative.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> About two months after this interview the captive princes of
the blood Royal were liberated from Guancho, in accordance with a
vow made by the Negoos whilst lying upon a bed of sickness, under
the impression that death was approaching, and that such an act
would propitiate heaven favourably for his recovery. It was a
spontaneous act, nor can any just claim be made by any one to
have instigated the Negoos to take this step. During his illness
he refused the aid and medicine of the Embassy, and it was a topic
of public conversation, that a monarch possessed of such abilities,
and so excellent a disposition as Sahale Selassee, should be so
under the influence of suspicion, as even in the extremity of
his illness on this occasion, he should have refused the proffered
assistance of European skill and knowledge, of which he had had
such evidences of superiority.</p>

<p class="footnote">The attention of our Embassy was first called more particularly
to the subject when the Ambassador and Captain Graham were
desired to attend at the palace the day when the liberated captives
came before their generous king. During that interview, when his
heart felt naturally the pride of having acted in the manner he had
done, Sahale Selassee turned to the English officers, whom he knew
were compiling a book, and asked for a compliment, by saying,
“Will you write this down?”</p>

<p class="footnote">I shall make but one more remark, that if indirect influence is to
be exaggerated into direct instigation, then I certainly claim to be
considered as the liberator of the Shoan princes; for I possess evidence
of the regard entertained for me by Sahale Selassee, and I have
more than once hinted to his Majesty the difference that existed
between the policy of European courts, as regarded the younger
branches of royalty, and that which was observed in Shoa. To his
courtiers, also, who conveyed to his ears every word that was said, I
always denounced the custom of imprisonment as most absurd and
cruel.</p>

countries to the south of Shoa; for example, Aboo Bogaboo, king
